A time spent alone with God is essential for the\nrealisation of the Christian objective, which is to grow up into\nmaturity: thus attaining the stature and fullness of Christ (Ephesians\n4:13-15). Thus, anyone who wants to become like Jesus must be\nready to develop a lasting intimacy with Him (Mark 3:13-14). Jesus\u2019\nearthly ministry showcases the example of intimacy with the Father.\nHe spent long period of time communing with the Father. The Bible reports that Jesus habitually rose early in the morning, often before\ndawn, to commune with the Father. In the evening, He frequently\nwent to the Mount of Olive or some quiet spots to pray. Jesus, at\nevery point in time was never unserious with prayer. He practised\nan unending communion with the Father, thus becoming a pattern\nfor all believers to follow. <\/p> \n        \n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD <\/h4> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n        \n        \n        \n        <ol type=\"A\">\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD -->\n        \n        \n        <li>\n        <h5> WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO SPEND TIME ALONE WITH GOD? <\/h5> <!-- SUB TOPIC --> <!--  EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD TITLE -->\n        <p> This is a disciple\u2019s deliberate effort to encounter the invisible\nGod. It involves separating oneself to speak to, listen and hear\nGod; to feel and perceive His revealed presence within and around\nthrough personal relationship. This can be done through songs,\nreading of God\u2019s Word, prayer and meditation for a specific period\nof time and in a certain quiet place. Spending time alone with\nGod requires having the desire to know, feel and experience God\nthrough closer walk with Him. It is a time when lives are molded\nor formed, fueled and refueled to build an effective, passionate\nministry. In addition, it helps a believer to be a more useful\ninstrument in God\u2019s hand, and to build a progressively vibrant\nrelationship with Him (John 15:15-16). <\/p> <!-- BODY CONTENT HERE -->\n      \n      <p> Sadly, many believers find it difficult to create time to\nexperience and know God better. Many are too busy with work,\nworldly pleasures, household chores, businesses, etc. This is\nprobably the reason many believers fail to grow into maturity. A\ntime alone with God is a time of spiritual exercise where a\nbeliever can receive strength for each day <\/p>\n        \n<\/li>\n\n        <li>\n        <h5> PURPOSE OF BEING ALONE WITH GOD <\/h5> <!-- SUB TOPIC --> <!--  EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD TITLE -->\n        <p> \n            \n            <ol>\n            <li><b>Fellowship with God:<\/b> Failure to seek God and spend time with\nHim alone means we are denying ourselves the ultimate purpose of salvation, which is to bring us into an intimate rich fellowship\nwith Him (1 John 1:3). Imagine spending an entire day with your\nfriend without acknowledging his\/her presence or communicating\nwith him\/her; how would your friend feel?Many believers treat\nGod this way when they fail to commune with Him. God expects\nour fellowship with Him to begin the moment we give our lives\nto Christ and should last a lifetime. God\u2019s greatest desire is for\nus to be in constant fellowship with Him (Mark 3:14.) <\/li>\n            <li><b>Friendship with God:<\/b> God longs for our friendship before our\nservices. Before you become a friend to someone, there is always\na meeting point where the relationship is established. Such a\nrelationship is built on trust. The amount of secret revealed to\nyou is commensurate to the level of trust such a friend has for\nyou. Trust grows from intimacy in a relationship (Job 22:21-28;\nIsaiah 1:16-19). <p> Reading through the Bible, we find out that those who were\nuseful instruments in the hand of God were first His trusted\nfriends. They were people who had good relationship with Him\nduring their lifetime. They heard Him speak to them from time to\ntime and spent quality time communing with Him. Examples are:\nAbraham, Moses, Ezekiel, Daniel, John the beloved, etc. God\nspoke to them from time to time because they had a relationship\nwith Him.Before the fall of humankind, God visited Adam in the\ncool of the day (Genesis 3:8a). David had this understanding and\nthis made him ask, \u201cwhat is man that thou visited him ...?\u201d (Psalms\n8:4). However, his response in Psalm 27:1-2 reveals his\ncommitment to daily commune with God to abide in Him.<\/p><\/li>\n            <li><b>Spiritual Growth:<\/b> Spiritual growth is the process of becoming\nmore and more like Jesus Christ. It is a state of growing unto\nmaturity in one\u2019s relationship with Jesus Christ. Spending time\nalone with Christ helps one grow spiritually. This should be the desire of every believer. This is probably why Paul\u2019s desire was\nto know Christ and the power of His resurrection. A spiritually\nmature believer will be able to \u201cdistinguish good from\nevil\u201d(Hebrews 5:14b). Spiritual growth begins the moment a\nperson comes to faith in Christ and continues until death.<\/li>\n            \n            <\/ol>\n\n        <\/p> <!-- BODY CONTENT HERE -->\n      \n        <p>\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\n        <!--  PLACE SHARING TIME CONTENT HERE BELOW -->\n      If you were to rate yourself, how has your attitude\nbeen towards fellowshipping with God?\n        <\/p>\n      \n        <\/li>\n\n        \n        <li>\n        <h5> WHAT TO DO WHEN SPENDING TIME ALONE WITH GOD <\/h5> <!-- SUB TOPIC --> <!--  EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD TITLE -->\n        <p>\n            <ol type=\"a\">\n            <li><b>Fervency in Prayer:<\/b> Prayer is one of the most important things\nto do when one is alone with God. It is simply talking with God\nas one would do to a beloved friend without pretence or\nflippancy. The attitude of a believer in the place of prayer should\nbe sincere and with a contrite heart. Thus, for prayer to be\nacceptable before God, it must be said in the right manner as\nJesus taught in the Bible (Colossians 4:2; Ephesians 6:18). <\/li>\n            <li><b>Solemn Worship:<\/b> This involves giving praises, adoration and\nthanksgiving to God through the singing of songs and Hymns\nto usher in God\u2019s presence and to bring down His glory.

It is the process of surrendering our will to that\nof our heavenly Father. Paul encourages believers to be filled with the\nfullness and love of God (Ephesians 3:16-19). We can make this a\nreality in our lives through submission. \u201cTo submit\u201d means giving\noneself over to the possession or power of another; to relinquish,\nsubmit, or yield. We must lose our \u2018natural\u2019 self to find our true self\n(John 12:24-25). Submission means that our individual independence\nfrom God is broken and our personality is liberated in dependence on\nHim, to be one with His will and purpose. <\/p> <!-- BODY CONTENT HERE -->\n      \n      <p>\n\n            <center>HOW CAN WE SUBMIT TO GOD?<\/center>\n\n            <ol>\n            \n            <li><b>Jesus Is Our Role Model of Submission : <\/b>  Jesus submitted His will to the Father, leaving the control of\nHis life completely in His Father\u2019s hands (John 5:19). Paul,in his\nbook to the Philippians,describes how Jesus\u2019 life was characterised\nby submission (Philippians 2:6-9); the reason, therefore, why Jesus\nrequires nothing less fromHis disciples (Mark 8:34-35; Matthew\n23:11-12; John 13:12-15). J.I. Packer wrote that we grow up into\nChrist by growing down into lowliness. That is, we grow greater by\ngrowing smaller.<\/li>\n            <li><b>Christ\u2019s Disciples Are to Submit to God by Opposing and\nResisting the Enemy, the Devil : <\/b>The Devil is always on the lookout to draw us away from God\nthrough worldly pleasures and enticements. The only means of\nresisting the antics of the Devil is by deliberate submission to God.\nThis will enable us turn from the worldly pleasures. And this can\nonly be done when we are ready to lay down our lives and follow\nJesus\u2019 example always. In practical sense, we must be dead to our emotions, plans and feelings.

We must co-operate with God through the spiritual\ndisciplines of daily prayer, studying of the Scriptures, spiritual\nwarfare, confession and acts of submission. These must all be done\nin the strength of the Spirit and not with the power of the flesh\n(Romans 8:13; Ephesians 6:10; Romans 14:17).<\/li>\n            <li><b>Submit to God by Yielding Your Members to Him (Colossians 3:5-7): <\/b> God sent the Holy Spirit to live in us and teach us the way we\nshould go. The reason is that the Holy Spirit is capable of helping\nus control the desires of the flesh and live without sin. He tells us\nwhat to do and how to do it. It is only in submitting to God that the\nHoly Spirit can live in us. When we allow the Holy Spirit into our lives, He will nullify the power of flesh in our mortal bodies.

When we are free from greed, anxiety, love of money,\npossessions and positions, only then can we obtain the full benefits\nand blessings of a simple life. <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s remarks here-->\n        \n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD <\/h4> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n        \n        \n        \n        <ol type=\"A\">\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD -->\n        \n        \n        <li>\n        <h5> SIMPLICITY IN LIFE <\/h5> <!-- SUB TOPIC --> <!--  EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD TITLE -->\n        <p> \n\u201cSimplicity is practising a lifestyle free of excess, greed and\ncovetousness and drawing closer to God and reaching out to others\nin compassionate service\u201d.

It is a frame\nof mind completely independent of all worldly passions.It is\nrevealed through inward attitude to life. According to E.F Brown,\n\u201cThe rock of our present day is that no one knows how to live upon\nlittle, yet the mind that has learned to appreciate the moral beauty\nof life, both as regards God and men can scarcely be greatly moved\nby any outward reserve of fortune and what our age wants most in\nthe sight of man, who might possess everything, yet being willingly\ncontented with little.\u201d Contentment comes when we understand\nthat our friendship with God is much more important than what we\nsee around us. When one focuses on living according to the direction\nand dictates of the Word of God, he becomes content in that his\nlife purpose will not be consumed by the things of this world. Also,\na contented life is built on the realization that possessions do not\nbring happiness but that relationship with God is more important\nthan earthly treasures. And above all,a good and cordial relationship\nwith God is the true foundation upon which life should be built. <\/li>\n        <li><b>Humbleness of Life (Philippians 2:1-8) : <\/b>  Many people, even Christians live only for people to have a good\nimpression about them or to please themselves. Jesus Christ lived a\nselfless life during His earthly ministry. He cared for everyone, regardless\nof tribe, race, gender, language, etc. He demonstrated a good example\nby putting others first. On the contrary, Christians today live selfishly,\nnot minding what happens to a brother or sister. Being humble is having\na true perspective about ourselves, and treating others with respect\nand courtesy. Apostle Paul, in his writing to the Philippians,warns them\nto guard against selfishness, prejudice and jealousy that might lead to\ndissension. He also encourages us to show genuine interest in others\nby taking positive steps towards maintaining unity among believers.\nJesus Christ was humble. He gave up His rights in order to obey God and\nserve humankind. Like Jesus, we should have a servant attitude, having\ngenuine love for God and for others (Mark 10:45)<\/li>\n        <li><b>Being Merciful and Doing Good to All Men(Luke 10:25-37;\nMatthew 5:38-48) : <\/b> Mercy is the act of showing kindness, compassion or forgiveness.\nMuch more than an emotional wave of pity, it demands a deliberate\neffort of the mind and will. It denotes sympathy which is not given, as\nit were, from outside, but comes from a deliberate identification with\nothers.It means seeing things the way others see them, and feeling\nthe way others do. Most people are so concerned about their feelings\nand not that of anyone else. From the passages above, Jesus emphasis\nis on doing good to everyone, regardless of who they are or where\nthey come from. Also, Paul in concluding his letter to the Galatian\nchurch says, \u201cSo then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all\nmen, especially to those who are members of the household of faith\u201d\n(Galatians 6:10).

Service to others includes service to the widows, orphans, less-\nprivileged, needy, prisoners, sick, church, community and nation\nat large. The implication of our service to others is that we are\nrendering service to God indirectly. When we serve others,we are\nserving God (Matthew 25:34-40).

God\u2019s plan\nis for the church to reach the whole world with the Gospel.

Jesus commissioned us in Acts 1:8 that all believers (disciples) are to be His witnesses everywhere. We must obey His command to us in Matthew 28:18-20 by making disciples of all nations. The Gospel must be preached in all the nations (Matthew 24:14; Luke 24:47; Mark 16:15; John 3:16).<\/p> \n\n<p>We are called to be children of the light, to shine forth the light of\nChrist to this dying world.

A\nFulani must be strong, must not show emotions openly, must be\ntemperate, etc. If the animal of a neighbour enters the farm of a\nFulani man, Pulaaku requires the Fulani man to handle the case with patience and calmness. He is to speak to the parents by simply\nsaying \u201cOur children are not very careful with the animals. This\nmade the animals to enter the farm to eat some things on the farm.\nLet us keep watch on our children\u201d. He is not to fight, get back or\nclaim any compensation. This could probably be the reason for the\nconstant fighting by the pastoralists and farmers. This is more of a\nproblem of lack of understanding of the differences in the culture of\nthe Fulanis and that of other tribes. With prayers, patience, love\nand understanding on the part of the Fulanis and other tribes, God\nwill help us to find a permanent solution to the recurrent bloodshed\nand clashes between the Fulanis and other tribes.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<li><b>Fulanis are human beings like us.<\/b>God wants us to love, accept\nand help them. None of us chose our tribes, our families, our towns,\nstates, nationalities, etc. God pre-chose everyone and made us to\nbe where we are and who we are today. We must always remember\nthat our tribes or where we come from largely determines our\nworldviews or how we see life vis-a-vis our behaviours, our choices,\nour comportments, etc. Let us relate with the Fulanis the way we\nwould want others to relate with us, if God had made us or had\npre-chosen us to come from the Fulani tribe or race. God is\ndepending on you to reveal Jesus Christ to the Fulanis; join hands\nwith God to make them disciples of the risen Lord.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol> <!-- BODY CONTENT HERE -->\n        \n        <\/li>\n\n        \n        <li>\n        <h5>BUILDING GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FULANIS<\/h5> \n\t\t<p>Based on the grace extended to my wife and I by God and the\nConvention family to serve as missionaries among the Fulanis for\nmore than two decades, here are some suggestions to guide and\nassist in reaching out to the Fulanis: <\/p> \n\t\t<li><b>Prayer:<\/b>Prayer is the most important tool for witnessing to\nMuslims. Prayer opens doors and hearts like nothing else will. We must intercede for them. We must make use of our God-given\nopportunity to pray with and for them. Fulanis and Muslims love\nand believe in prayers to God. As they see God answering your\nprayers for them, the barriers will be broken. This will make them\nto be interested in our own God: the One who answers prayers.<\/li>\n\t\t<li><b>Show Love:<\/b>Love is the heart of Christianity. Love for God and\nlove for everyone (Matthew 22:37-39). Jesus Christ even asked us\nto go the extra mile by loving those who are our enemies (Matthew\n5:43-48). Love is a very strong weapon that the church can use to\nwin souls to God\u2019s kingdom. Correction and rebuke will be accepted\nwithout resentment by people when they know it is coming from a\nheart that loves them. To reach out to the Fulanis and other\nMuslims, we must show them agape love in all ways. By showing\nthem that we love and care for them, they will accept our\nfriendships and consequently this will make it possible for us to\nreveal God\u2019s love to them. You must give yourself to your Fulani\nand Muslim friend, not just the Gospel.<\/li>\n\t\t<li><b>Share Our Personal Testimonies with Them:<\/b>\n\t\t\t<p>Sharing personal\ntestimonies with our Fulani and Muslim friends is another powerful\ntool for witnessing than anything else. If anyone offers to give a\npill to a sick Fulani friend, the first question he will likely ask is:\n\u2018Have you taken this pill before?\u2019 The second one is closely related:\n\u2018When you took it, what was the effect on your body?\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p>Once your answers to these two questions are favourable, the\nFulani friend will also take the pill hoping to have the same\nexperience. The same way they will react to any personal testimony\nthat will show them what God has done for you. Your sincere personal\ntestimony will be appreciated and such will create a hunger in his life for such a loving relationship with God. In sharing your personal\ntestimony, consider the following helpful tips:<\/p>\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t<li>Never get involved in arguments when trying to tell them\nabout Christ. Nominal and even irreligious Muslims may\nbecome fanatical when pushed into arguments.<\/li>\n\t\t<li>Be a witness, not a debater.<\/li>\n\t\t<li>Never speak negatively about his religion, holy book,\ncultural belief or prophet.\nJust go straight to the point by telling him what Jesus has done for\nyou.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<li><b>Let Them Know about the Hope that You Have Received:<\/b>\n\t\tYou may\nopen the dialogue by asking him or her to share with you what he\nbelieves vis-\u00e0-vis his religion. Remember to respect his culture and\nhis conviction. Be patient with him and continue to show love even\nwhile sharing the Gospel prayerfully. Also have faith in God, because\nonly Him can change lives through the power of the Holy Spirit (John\n16:8-14). In addition to this; it will be helpful to make use of dialogue\ninstead of monologue in witnessing. Let us follow the example of\nJesus Christ as He witnessed to the Samaritan woman in John 4:4-\n29.Lead him through the Bible by revealing how God provided a way\nfor forgiveness of sin and salvation. This is a powerful tool for\nwitnessing.\n\t\t<\/li>\t\n\t\t<li><b>Contextualization and Costume Evangelism Is Very Important:<\/b>A good knowledge of the Fulani and Muslim culture, worldview,\npractice and belief will help us to be better witnesses. It will guide\nand help us in understanding why they do what they do. We must\ndress in acceptable ways to reach and touch their hearts for the\nLord. Many Muslims and Fulanis will form wrong opinions about\nus and will block their minds from what we are sharing with them when we dress in unacceptable ways. Costume evangelism is\nimperative in Muslim and Fulani Evangelism. We must follow the\nexample of Apostle Paul by becoming everything to all men so as\nto win some for Christ (1Corinthians 9:22).<\/li>\t\n\t\t<li><b>Be Patient and Depend on the Power of God through His Holy\nSpirit within You:<\/b>Satan\u2019s desire is to make us think that our Muslim\nand Fulani friends are unreachable, difficult or even dangerous to\nwitness to. Let us always remember that God has promised to be\nwith us as we share His love with others. He is the One doing the\nwork through us. Let us depend on Him to see us through. While it is\ntrue that Islam and Fulani cultures are difficult to penetrate, we must\nalways remember that nothing is impossible with God. We must be\nready to make ourselves available, be patient and depend on God.<\/li>           \n        \n        \n <!-- BODY CONTENT HERE -->     \n        \n\n        <!-- END OF EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD -->\n        <\/ol>\n\n\n        <h4> Facilitator\\'s Closing Remarks <\/h4>\n        <p>  \u2026 Ye shall be my witnesses (Acts 1:8).

To be accountable is to be\nresponsible for a thing that is done. As believers, the reason why\nmany default on financial matters is because they spend money\nwithout bearing in mind that they will give account of whatever\nthey have done with the money. As believers, we should be\nreminded that God will require a proper account of the resources\nthat He has given to us, especially our time, gifts, talents and\nmoney. The Bible says in Romans 14:12, \u201cSo then every one of us\nshall give account of himself to God.\u201d<\/p> \n\t\t\t\t<p>God\u2019s requirement of accountability is primarily to Him since\nHe put all things in our care. This is the reason people around us\nshould see our lives as a true example of accountability. We must\nbe prudent in spending and wise in financial transactions. Prudence\nin resource management is possible when we are good managers\nof God\u2019s resources. This informs the reason every Christian should\nhave a financial plan or else, we will be creating room for financial\npain. Pain is a sign of disorder; therefore, to experience financial\npain is a sign of disorder in our spending pattern.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Requirement for Accountability<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>What is the first step a Christian should take in financial\naccountability? Keep Records! Record keeping is a requirement for\naccountability. Disciples of Christ should have proper documentation of their financial transactions. We should learn to keep record of all\nincomes as well as expenditures. When we list out our incomes and\nexpenditures and review them from time to time, we would be able to\nassess whether our financial transactions are prudent or there is the\nneed to adjust our spending pattern. Periodically, we can make a list\nof the items we buy or spend money on and the amount spent on each\nitem. We may choose to do this monthly, weekly or daily.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Keeping accurate records is very important. A small diary may\nbe needed to keep and track record of expenditures and income on\na daily, weekly and monthly basis. This makes it easy to compile a\nfamily financial report. A copy of this report should be made\navailable to our spouse and both partner should be carried along\nin all spending. This will help a great deal in being accountable to\nGod and each other. It will also help each one to have a clear\nconscience and be a worthy example for those around to follow.\nRemember what the Lord said to the faithful servant in Matthew\n25:21, \u201c\u2026 thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful\nover a few things, I will make you ruler over many things \u2026\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Benefits of Accountability<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>One major benefit of accountability is financial fruitfulness.\nOne stands the chance of receiving more blessings from God and\nfellow men. When a believer is accountable in little, he or she will\nreceive more. Thus every believer needs the grace of God to be\nfaithful stewards, especially in money management. A proper\nrelationship with God is determined in great measure by our\nattitude and faithfulness to God\u2019s Word.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Other Attributes Needed<\/b>\n\t\t\t<p>It is unfortunate that some Christians think that tithing and learning\nto live on budget are all that is required to reflect a right attitudes to money and stewardship of possessions. Such Christians need to be told\nthat God will honour right attitudes only when they reflect proper spiritual\nvalues especially in the handling of finances. Right attitude must reflect\na total commitment to God, which includes such things as:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Listening to godly counsel (especially from our spouses) and\napplying the counsel prayerfully;<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Dealing fairly and honestly with other people;<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Being humble and grateful to God always;<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Forgiving others (including relieving people of debts that are\nowed).<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol> \n\t\t<p><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>Give reasons why couples fail to keep\ntransparent record of their family finances.<\/p><!-- BODY CONTENT HERE -->\n     \n        <\/li>\n\n        \n        <li>\n        <h5>STEPS IN MANAGING FAMILY FINANCES<\/h5> \n\t\t<p>Below are five suggested steps to manage family finances:<\/p>\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Pray together<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Couples should pray together before discussing family finances.\nThe reason is that they need the spirit of patience, a graceful heart,\nand honesty in handling such issues.

The way we use money and other\n\u201cthings\u201d reflect the true state of our relationship with God.\nNo matter the state of our finances, it is important to learn basic\nbiblical principles of handling God\u2019s resources. This is called\nstewardship. A steward manages someone else\u2019s property. We must\nmanage that which belongs to God, which He has entrusted to us\nmeticulously. <\/p>  \n\t\t<p>God entrusts His resources to each one according to everyone\u2019s\nability.

Though the level\nof resources may vary greatly, the level of accountability is the\nsame--100 percent. Everyone will be accountable to God for the management of God\u2019s resources. When we understand God\u2019s\nbiblical principles and goals, methods of managing God\u2019s resources\ncan be an exciting adventure instead of a problem. It is important\nfor us to be good managers of God\u2019s resources in our care.<\/p><!-- Facilitator\\'s remarks here-->\n        \n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD <\/h4> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->       \n        \n        <ol type=\"A\">\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD -->\n        \n        \n        <li>\n        <h5>ACCOUNTABILITY IS THE WATCHWORD <\/h5> <!-- SUB TOPIC --> <!--  EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD TITLE -->\n      \t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li><b>The Need for Accountability<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Accountability is responsibility. To be accountable is to be\nresponsible for a thing that is done. As believers, the reason why\nmany default on financial matters is because they spend money\nwithout bearing in mind that they will give account of whatever\nthey have done with the money. As believers, we should be\nreminded that God will require a proper account of the resources\nthat He has given to us, especially our time, gifts, talents and\nmoney. The Bible says in Romans 14:12, \u201cSo then every one of us\nshall give account of himself to God.\u201d<\/p> \n\t\t\t\t<p>God\u2019s requirement of accountability is primarily to Him since\nHe put all things in our care. This is the reason people around us\nshould see our lives as a true example of accountability. We must\nbe prudent in spending and wise in financial transactions. Prudence\nin resource management is possible when we are good managers\nof God\u2019s resources. This informs the reason every Christian should\nhave a financial plan or else, we will be creating room for financial\npain. Pain is a sign of disorder; therefore, to experience financial\npain is a sign of disorder in our spending pattern.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Requirement for Accountability<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>What is the first step a Christian should take in financial\naccountability? Keep Records! Record keeping is a requirement for\naccountability. Disciples of Christ should have proper documentation of their financial transactions. We should learn to keep record of all\nincomes as well as expenditures. When we list out our incomes and\nexpenditures and review them from time to time, we would be able to\nassess whether our financial transactions are prudent or there is the\nneed to adjust our spending pattern. Periodically, we can make a list\nof the items we buy or spend money on and the amount spent on each\nitem. We may choose to do this monthly, weekly or daily.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Keeping accurate records is very important. A small diary may\nbe needed to keep and track record of expenditures and income on\na daily, weekly and monthly basis. This makes it easy to compile a\nfamily financial report. A copy of this report should be made\navailable to our spouse and both partner should be carried along\nin all spending. This will help a great deal in being accountable to\nGod and each other. It will also help each one to have a clear\nconscience and be a worthy example for those around to follow.\nRemember what the Lord said to the faithful servant in Matthew\n25:21, \u201c\u2026 thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful\nover a few things, I will make you ruler over many things \u2026\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Benefits of Accountability<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>One major benefit of accountability is financial fruitfulness.\nOne stands the chance of receiving more blessings from God and\nfellow men. When a believer is accountable in little, he or she will\nreceive more. Thus every believer needs the grace of God to be\nfaithful stewards, especially in money management. A proper\nrelationship with God is determined in great measure by our\nattitude and faithfulness to God\u2019s Word.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Other Attributes Needed<\/b>\n\t\t\t<p>It is unfortunate that some Christians think that tithing and learning\nto live on budget are all that is required to reflect a right attitudes to money and stewardship of possessions. Such Christians need to be told\nthat God will honour right attitudes only when they reflect proper spiritual\nvalues especially in the handling of finances. Right attitude must reflect\na total commitment to God, which includes such things as:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Listening to godly counsel (especially from our spouses) and\napplying the counsel prayerfully;<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Dealing fairly and honestly with other people;<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Being humble and grateful to God always;<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Forgiving others (including relieving people of debts that are\nowed).<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol> \n\t\t<p><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>Give reasons why couples fail to keep\ntransparent record of their family finances.<\/p><!-- BODY CONTENT HERE -->\n     \n        <\/li>\n\n        \n        <li>\n        <h5>STEPS IN MANAGING FAMILY FINANCES<\/h5> \n\t\t<p>Below are five suggested steps to manage family finances:<\/p>\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Pray together<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Couples should pray together before discussing family finances.\nThe reason is that they need the spirit of patience, a graceful heart,\nand honesty in handling such issues.

Remember, God knows and\nsees the heart of both parties.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Bring it all together<\/b>\n\t\t\t<p>After seeking God\u2019s face concerning any financial issue, the next\nthing is for couples to have a file for all account(s) or bank\nstatements, cheque books, and insurance documents. Where\ncouples are not operating joint account, both still need to disclose\nor give a true statement of their account(s). Also, they should\ndisclose their individual debts, amount and the interest thereof. Couples must always be transparent in all their financial dealings.\nWe should always remember what the Bible says in Luke 16:11,\u201dIf\nthen you have not been faithful in the unrighteous wealth, who\nwill entrust to you the true riches?\u201d<\/p><\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Total it up<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>This might be painful and a bit difficult, but it is necessary. Having\nlisted out all debts and liabilities, couples should also do the same\nfor their assets and income. Couples need to be aware of when\nand how their income will be received and how and when their\ndebts and liabilities should be repaid. The sharing formula for\nhandling family commitments must be jointly agreed upon.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Consider what you have<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Couples are to examine whether they both have life insurance\npolicies and whether they understand the statements\/contract\nnotes on their investments.

The key advantage of\nmultiple streams of income is that it gives room for a diversified\nrevenue source. The collapse of one source of income will not result\nin complete loss of source of revenue. Adoption of multiple streams\nof income philosophy is more or less a decision of not putting all\none\u2019s eggs in a basket.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>In practice, adopting the multiple income streams is a means that\nsaves one from getting stuck on a paid job without giving attention to\nanything else. For example, what happens if someone loses his paid job\nlike thousands of employees did during the economic meltdown? Well,\nif all that he has is the paid job, then losing it will be disastrous. However,\nwhen there are other streams of income, losing the paid job will not\ndestabilize such an individual. Other benefits of having multiple income\nstreams include peace of mind. It gives an assurance of additional income\nto earn more in order to cater for the numerous needs of the family.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Streams of income are in two groups- passive stream and active\nstream. Passive stream of income includes regular earnings from\nsources other than an employer or contractor. It usually comes from\ntwo sources; rental income or a business in which an individual does\nnot actively participate. For example, it includes book royalties and\ndividend paying stocks. Active streams of income are earnings\/wages\nreceived from sources like the employer or the contractor (paid job).<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Additional income streams can be active, passive or a combination of\nboth. Someone can be paid for doing something that he loves to do (active),\nwhile income can be received without having to do much of anything at all\n(passive). Also, an individual can diversify income streams among different\nindustries to protect him against major losses during downturns in the market\nand to financially benefit from the upswings in another.<\/p>\n\t\t<h5><b>Basic Process for Creating Multiple Streams of Income<\/b><\/h5>\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Encounter with the Maker<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>It is important to seek the face of God to identify areas of exploits,\nas a believer, that would be beneficial to the family. However, one\nmust be prepared to obey God and have a broad vision to\naccommodate both active and passive streams of income.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Security of the Primary Source of Income<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Do not focus your time and energy on building a second stream\nof income until your primary source is secured. Whether you\nhave a paid job or own a business, focus on establishing and\nsecuring a primary monthly income that will support your\nexpenses before you pursue the dream of other sources.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Identify Your Unique Value<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Everyone has unique gifts, abilities, life experiences and value\nto offer, which can be highly compensated for. It is good we\nidentify the knowledge, experience, ability or solution that will\nbe of value and which one can be paid for. Remember, what\nmay be common knowledge to you may not be for other people.\nIn addition, our personality will differentiate our values from\nthose of others. How we package what we have will differentiate\nour values or products. Knowledge is one thing that we also\nneed. Increase in knowledge of our areas of expertise\nwill increase our value .<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Identify Your Market and Explore the Potentials<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>We must determine where best we can serve. When we think of\nthe value we can add to others or the problems we can solve, this\nwould help determine our pay at the end. We can identify a need\nin a community and invest valuable time in meeting such need or\naddressing it. The market could be segregated into different areas\nsuch as children\u2019s need, youths\u2019 need and adults\u2019 need in order to\naddress each growing sector evenly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Other methods of identifying needs in a community include\nsending of e-mails to members of a community to carry out\nsurvey or dispatching of questionnaires to determine what they\nwant or need. This should be done to help us know if we have\nthe capacity to provide them. Also, we can ask open-ended\nquestions to help define issues confronting members in a\ncommunity, and later brainstorm or provide multiple choices\nto them if they fall within our area of expertise.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Create a Solution and Solve the Problem<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>We can identify the need of community members and begin to\nwork on them. These needs may include physical or digital\nproducts (a book, audio, video tapes, a written training programme\nor software) or a service (supply of water, dog breeding, baby\nsitting, coaching, consulting, public speaking or training).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Identify and Emulate a Mentor<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The best way to cut our learning curve and achieve results is to\nidentify people who have grown in such a chosen career over\nthe years and learn from them. Rather than trying to figure\nthings out on our own, we can find someone who has made\nremarkable progress in this area.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>We can study how he was able to make it and use his\nknowledge as template for our own. Also, we might need to\nengage in close relationship with a mentor in that field, hire a\ncoach, read books or articles written by experts or do\nweb research. When we take time to implement the above\nsteps, we would enjoy the benefits and freedom that multiple\nstreams of income provide.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t<h5><b>Opportunities Available for Creation of Multiple Streams\nof Income<\/b><\/h5>\n\t\t<p>Various opportunities available for creation of multiple streams\nof income are as follows:<\/p>\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li>Connecting potential buyers or tenants to property owners (e.g.\nreal estate agents).<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Dealership opportunities (e.g. business ventures, trading and\nmarketing outfits).<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Training\/teaching opportunities on what you know (e.g. bead\/\nshoe making, ice cream production, soap making, candle\nmaking, fashion designing, etc.).<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Consulting opportunities (e.g. marriage counselling,\nprofessional courses tutorship and networking, software\nconsulting, etc.)Selling information in hard book format (book\nroyalties).<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Selling information in the form of downloadable e-Books.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Selling information as audio tapes and downloadable tutorial\nmaterials,<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Making money from referral opportunities (e.g. part-time\ninsurance agent).<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Marking of scripts for professional and academic courses.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Outsourcing opportunities (e.g. talents, human resources and\nfacilities).<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Manufacturing opportunities (e.g. products and inputs).<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Partnership opportunities (e.g. shares) and design opportunities.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Investment opportunities (e.g. stock market, bonds, deposits,\ntreasury bills, real estate, etc.).<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Exporting processed agriculture and agro allied products.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Home gardening and domestic sales (e.g. water melon, maize,\npepper, tomatoes, etc.).<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t<p>The list above is not exhaustive.

This is\nthe reason why saving towards emergency is crucial- a way of preparing\nahead for financial hardship. In simple terms, emergency fund is\nmoney saved or set aside for future contingencies or to help through\nthe period of financial hardships.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>As Christians, cultivating the habit of subscribing to some financial\nschemes like cooperative society, thrift associations, contributory\nretirement scheme and maintaining an insurance policy can help put\nresources together for savings and investment over time. Such funds\ncould serve as emergency fund, whether on or before its maturity- it\ncould meet family needs and help to support capital programmes of the\nfamily and for God\u2019s work on medium or long-term basis. Whether you\nhave lost your job, your business isnot making profit, or you made some\npoor financial decisions, daily or weekly emergency savings will give\nyou a safe net to fall back on until the economic recession is over and\nyou are able to find your feet.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Family members are encouraged to save about 3 to 6 months\u2019\nworth of wages\/earnings each year, so that when the economy is in\ncrisis and income is irregular due to delay in payment of salaries, you\nwill not have to start borrowing. Using credit as a safety net is a mistake\nthat often haunts people for years. Tough times may last longer than\none anticipates, so accumulating debts during these times may be\ndifficult to pay. Since most people are used to living on their entire pay\ncheque, they do not usually have anything extra to pay debts. So, they\nhave to either increase their income or significantly reduce their lifestyle\nspending to afford paying the debts from their current income. Chances\nare that you will not be saving money in a challenging period because\nyou will have other financial matters to settle, so it is best to start\nsaving before a financial downturn hits.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Diversification into Agricultural Ventures<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Another way of surviving financial hardship is to delve into\nagricultural ventures. Land can be cultivated to plant such things\nlike; pineapple suckers, coconut and fruits. When harvested, these\ncan be processed into beverages for local market and export.\nTomatoes, peppers and vegetables can be planted and processed\ninto paste when harvested, and sold out for local consumption.\nPlantain suckers, cassava and cashew can be planted, harvested\nand exported or sold out at local markets. Embarking on fish farm,\nsnailry, rearing of rabbits, chicken, turkeys and pigs could help meet\nthe local demand and export need as well. All these will provide\nadditional source of foreign and local earnings if well harnessed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Diversify Your Income<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Most of us are familiar with the saying, \u201cDo not put all your\neggs in one basket,\u201d this adage can be applied to your source of\nincome too. Relying solely on a particular job for all your income\nhas inherent risk, because if the economy faces challenges and\nyou lose your job, you will also lose your only income and your\nability to meet all your financial obligations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Having multiple streams of income can really help. If one income source\nstarts to dwindle \u2013 or gets eliminated completely \u2013 you have other sources\nto fall back on to help keep you afloat. Diversifying your income doesnot\nnecessarily entail getting a second job. In fact, if your spouse is working in\na different industry from yours, you have some income diversity already.\nHowever, if you\u2019d like to spread your tentacles and bring in some more\nincome, you can look into many different options such as renting out some\nspace in your home, renting out a space in your garage for business use, or\ngoing as far as buying a commercial property and renting it out.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>If you have a fairly flexible schedule you can consider getting a\nweekend job, and if you have a particularly entrepreneurship spirit\nand strong skill\/endowment or are developing one, you can look\nfor ways to cash in on those skills. For example, if you are a good \nwriter, you can look into freelancing articles and blog posts, if you\nare comical, you can join the comic group; additional skill in bead\nmaking, shoe making, sewing\/fashion designing, barbing, hair\ndressing skills can fetch additional income when put to use. If you\nare also handy around the house, you can consider rendering\nprofessional services or start a consultancy firm at weekend or\nafter the day\u2019s work and also advertise your services on websites.\nDo not let these examples limit you. Any skill or talent you have\ncan potentially be turned into an avenue to earn extra income.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Diversify Your Investments<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>In addition to diversifying your income, it is important to\ndiversify your investments. If you have most of your money tied up\nin stock market investments, an economic downturn could be a\nfinancial disaster since all your money is tied up in one type of\ninvestment. It is for this reason that diversifying your investments\nis key. Go through your investment portfolio and make sure your\ninvestments are spread out across different industries and assets\nso that when the market tumbles, your investments won\u2019t be\naffected and your losses will not be severe.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>When it comes to diversification, you can invest your money in\na number of different investment portfolios:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Real estate<\/b> - whether it is buying a home, a property, or even\nland\u2014it is a common investment that generally appreciates over\ntime.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Investing in stocks\/shares<\/b> - is a good way to help your portfolio\ngrow.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Bonds <\/b>is also a good way of attracting returns as income.\nOthers are mutual funds, placement of funds for treasury bills,\nfixed deposits; bankers\u2019 acceptances, these all attract returns.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>International investments: <\/b>that is diversifying into other\ncountries can also help to reduce the vulnerability in an\neconomic downturn.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t\t\t<p>An investor must evaluate, explore and invest his fund based on\nboth security factor coupled with higher return factor.

Believers should support mission work\nand missionaries. When we use the money God has given us for\ngood purposes, it will earn us good names in the sight of God and\nhumankind; which is true religion (James 1:27).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Maintaining a More Frugal and Disciplined Lifestyle<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Reducing and learning how to live frugally and a disciplined lifestyle\ncan be a great strategy, because if you can learn to make do with less,\nyou will increase your savings and you won\u2019t find yourself struggling\nto adapt to a new lifestyle when things become tough.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Living frugally and a disciplined lifestyle is not as difficult as it sounds,\nand contrary to popular opinion, a frugal lifestyle isnot about pinching\npennies and depriving yourself of things that can bring you joy. Rather it\nis about making conscious choices on spending in order to reduce\nwasteful expenses, with minimal negative impact on your lifestyle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>There are lots of ways you can start living frugally. If your family has two\nvehicles, consider reducing it to one and make use of the public transit\nsometimes. This choice alone can save you some more money in a year.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>If you have two cars, consider selling one of the cars for a more\nfuel efficient sub-compact vehicle to enjoy some savings as regards\ngas\/fuel bills.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>You can also look into renting out your un-used home or apartment space.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Reduce your groceries and fast food joints spending (eat more\nat home).<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Spend less on festive and ceremonial dresses.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Scale down on your cell phone bills.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t\t\t<p>As we live a disciplined lifestyle, we should use our resources\/\nmoney endowed to us by God to take care of the home and buy\nfood and other basic needs. Parents should take care of their\nchildren and their education. We should also take care of our\nparents by honouring them with our resources (Ephesians 6:2-3).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>It is necessary to review and cut down on wasteful spending.\nThe key is to ensure the cuts you are making are not to the extreme,\nor it will be difficult for you to maintain such in the future.

During a challenging period when jobs are scarce and money\nis not forthcoming, those high debt payments will only add more\nstress to an already stressful situation. So, it is time to take stock\nof your financial situation and all your payment obligations, and\nmake a plan to pay off your debts.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>During a challenging period, it can be difficult to cover day-today\nexpenses \u2013 let alone make debt repayments- this can cause\nyour debt to skyrocket and out of control. Having high levels of\ndebt is very risky, because a slight change in external factors can\naffect your ability to pay your debt. Although you may be able to\nmanage payments now, a job loss or an interest rate hike combined\nwith banks tightening credit limits could change that for the worse.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The first step to successfully pay off your debts is establishing a\nbudget that accurately reflects the money coming into your household,\nand where that money is supposed to go. If you are not tackling your\ndebt as aggressively as you should, or worse still, if you add to your\ndebt, having a budget will help you identify spending areas you can\ncut down on so that more of your earnings can be saved towards\npaying off your debt. A household budget would help guide you on\nhow to live within your means and manage your money better.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Expand Your Skills<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>During challenging periods, organizations need people to do the\nwork necessary to run their businesses. Getting educated and improving\nyour skill over time helps make you less expendable during a recession.\nThe broader your skill set, the greater options you have for new work,\neven after being laid off. The more distinct and deep your skills for a\ncertain position, making you pivotal in daily operations, the less likely\nthe company or organization can disengage you, even when it tries to.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Renegotiation and Pricing<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Family members and parents are encouraged to renegotiate bills,\nexpenses and contract to be entered into during recession\/hardship\nperiod. Value must be received for service rendered or product\npurchased, expenditure prices must be negotiated to enjoy some\ndiscounts and savings for the family.

Both cities were on the coast of the\nSea of Galilee. Peter had a brother called Andrew; they were into\nfishing business with other two sons of Zebedee, James and John. \nHe had a wife (Matthew 8:14-15). Peter was one of the three core\ndisciples of Jesus Christ (Matthew 17:1). He was also a man with\npassion, outspoken, strong-willed, impulsive and at times impatient.\nHe was a man with several shortcomings but never remained there.\nHe later became a recognised leader of Jesus\u2019 disciples.<\/p>\n\n\t\t<h5><b>Peter\u2019s Denials of Jesus<\/b><\/h5>\n\t\t<p>Apostle Peter faced a difficult situation when he was asked to\naffirm his relationship with Jesus. He denied Jesus Christ three\ntimes on identity question. Peter could not stand the test of his\nloyalty for his master. He refused to acknowledge his association\nwith Jesus and could not identify with Him in trial. Peter\u2019s faith\nand life became challenged because of the question posed at him.\nThere are many believers today who probably because of threat\nhave denied their Lord just the way Peter did. Some denied Christ\nto identify with the society, get admission, jobs, contracts, business\nconnections, or fulfil their political ambition. Surely, our loyalty to\nJesus will be put to test but at such times, will you deny Jesus or\ndeclare your total allegiance to Him?<\/p>\n\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time: <\/b>Mention some ways in which Christians deny Jesus\ntoday. Mention some situations that threaten believers\u2019 allegiance\nto Christ.<\/h5>\n\n\t\t<h5><b>Peter\u2019s Response to His Fall<\/b><\/h5>\n\t\t<p>Peter thought he could stand against any threat with his\ncommitment to the Lord (Luke 22:33). Even if it came to laying\ndown his life for his Master, he was ready to do it.; but he eventually\nfailed (v. 60). This is to let us know, as Christ\u2019s disciples, that our\npower and strength cannot help us in time of trials or temptations.\nWe need the power of the Holy Spirit to help us stand and face any\nsituation that threatens our stand in Jesus.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Peter recognised his shortfall; he remembered Jesus\u2019 word\nabout his denial and wept bitterly (Matthew 26:75). Peter\ndiscovered his sin; he never gave excuses but emptied himself\nbefore his Master and pleaded for forgiveness. Peter\u2019s ability to\nrecognise his mistake and his approach to reconcile with his Master,\nis worthy of praise and emulation as believers. Nobody is immune\nto temptations and trials of faith. When trials and temptations\ncome,a believer must take drastic steps to avoid falling into the pit\nof sin. Anyone who has fallen should not remain there in self-pity.\nHe\/she must ask for Jesus\u2019 help and restoration. Peter was forgiven\nand restored unlike Judas who resorted to suicide.<\/p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<h5><b>Lessons from the Life of Peter<\/b><\/h5>\n\t\t<p>Peter was called by Jesus Christ to be His follower and to make\nhim a fisher of men (Matthew 4:19). Peter was not a perfect man\nbut the Lord chose him to mold his life to become what He intended\nhim to be. His life was characterised with ups and downs, falling\nand rising. Apostle Peter was known to be bold and outspoken\namong Jesus\u2019 disciples. He always took the lead. In fact, he was\none of the closest friends of Jesus Christ. He was together with\nJames and John at Jesus\u2019 transfiguration; prayer at Gethsemane;\netc. During the trial of Jesus before the Sanhedrin; the Jewish\nreligious council, Peter followed Jesus secretly because of his love\nfor his Master. His loyalty to Jesus Christ made him follow Jesus. A\ndisciple must always demonstrate love and loyalty for Jesus at all\ntimes.<\/p>\n\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time: <\/b>What is the relevance of keeping God\u2019s Word in our\nhearts as believers?<\/h5>\n  \n <!-- BODY CONTENT HERE -->     \n      \n\n        <!-- END OF EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD -->\n\n        <h4> Facilitator\\'s Closing Remarks <\/h4>\n        <p>  The life of Apostle Peter is full of lessons for contemporary\nChristians. He was a sincere man who never felt too big to humble\nhimself at Jesus\u2019 feet to ask for forgiveness anytime he fell. Though\nhe denied Christ at a crucial time, yet he discovered himself, and\ncried for help and forgiveness. He was forgiven and restored and\nhe became the leader of Christ\u2019s church i.e. the early church in\nJerusalem.

He was a member of the\nSanhedrin, the group of Jewish religious leaders (Luke 23:50) that called\nfor Jesus\u2019 crucifixion. He was a wealthy man (Matthew 27:57) and a\nsecret follower of Jesus Christ (Mark 15:43).

Such was not the case with\nJoseph of Arimathea. He stood by his Master when He was alive and\neven in death; he did not abandon Him to the cross. Joseph took the\nrisk of going to Pilate to request Jesus\u2019 body for burial. He strictly\nfollowed Jewish custom for his Master\u2019s burial (Luke 23:53).<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Joseph of Arimathea released himself to be used of God to fulfil the\nprophecy of Isaiah about the burial of Jesus Christ (Isaiah 53:9). A disciple \nof Jesus Christ must readily release himself to the Master to fulfil His\npurpose. He must not deny God access to his life.

Here, we are\ntalking about how a man should relate with his wife; and a wife with\nher husband in the home; and live happily together. It is a pity that\nmany marriages have collapsed as a result of inability of both husband\nand wife to relate well in the home. Many couples do not relate well\nbecause of some personal or individual interests that have crept into\ntheir lives. Such interests may be work, hobby, pursuits, or activities.\nIt becomes an issue when in view of the above, a spouse does not\nreceive the attention required or needed. The simple solution here is\nthat husbands and wives should avoid anything that could become a\nstumbling block to having close contacts between them.<\/p>\n\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>As a husband or wife, how have you been relating\nwith your spouse?.<\/h5>\n\n\t\t<h5><b>Ways by which Couples Can Destroy their Marriage<\/b><\/h5>\n\t\t<p>A preacher, Ron Edmondson once revealed some ways by which\ncouples can destroy their marriage or home. They include:<\/p>\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Unresolved Conflicts<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Couples do not relate well due to conflicts that are not properly\nresolved, or linger for a long time. It is often said that when a\ntree is cut, it can sprout leaves and branches again.\nUnfortunately many couples fail to take time and patience to\nresolve their conflicts amicably. When a conflict is left\nunresolved over a long time, it gives birth to more conflict and\nlater become issues that could destroy the home. The solution\nis that couples should find amicable ways of settling their\nconflicts, especially before they escalate to the point of not\nbeing able to resolve it among themselves. Couples that are \nunable to relate well, as someone rightly observed, \u201c are only\nco-tenants under the same roof\u201d.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Couple\u2019s Inability to Have the Same Goal, Vision or Dream<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>In an ideal Christian home, couples do have goals, visions and dreams\nand work together towards achieving them. On the contrary, when a\nhusband and his wife are unable to harmonise their plans, goals or\ndreams, and work together to achieve them, it becomes difficult for them\nto relate well as each of them have decided to do things his own way. This\ncould be very dangerous for both of them and the family as a whole.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Boredom<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>In many homes today, there is no longer a cordial relationship among\nmembers of the family; chatting, playing and having fun together.\nMany couples venture into businesses without informing their\nspouses especially with the present overwhelming economic\nchallenges. In addition, the advent of computer, Iphones and Ipads\nhave brought separation among couples that many have no or\nlimited time to interact with each other and members of the family,\nbut rather keep themselves busy with the social media. Worse still,\nsome couples seek fulfillment and excitement in places such as the\nbeer parlour, eateries, cinemas, etc. neglecting the fellowship of\ntheir spouses and other members of the family. This is a dangerous\ntrend indeed. Couples will do well if they can rekindle their love and\ncommitment through some definite and deliberate actions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Pursuing Separate Agenda<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Although couples do not have to work in the same place, hold the same\nstatus, hold or own one bank account, if not practically possible;however,\nthey can pursue the same goal, for the sake of their home and family. A\nsituation where one spouse feels it is a car they need, while the other\nfeels that it is a house they need to build and each is pursuing his own\nagenda, success may be far from them. There is always the need for\ncompromise and agreement in the home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Period: <\/b>What impact does agreement have in the success of marriages?.<\/h5>\n\n\t\t<h5><b>How Can Couples Relate Well in the Home?<\/b><\/h5>\n\t\t<p>Below are few suggestions:<\/p>\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li>Always be conscious of your beginning.

Within\nthe same text, the Bible also commands parents not to provoke their\nchildren to anger. How do we balance this? Let\u2019s quickly remind\nourselves that in Deuteronomy 6:4\u20137, we have been enjoined to bring\nup children in the way of the Lord; as we walk, sleep, work, relate, etc.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Hence, as believers, if we are to relate well with children in\nthe home, it must begin from their childhood. It is important to\ninculcate in them the habit of relating well with one another during\nthe family altar, assisting in doing the house chores, discussing\ntheir worries and other things they may be passing through. As\nparents, we should give them a listening ear, and counsel them\nwhen there is need for it. We must not at any point shout them\ndown but instead, correct them in love. By so doing, they will grow\nto become so relational that the children themselves will enjoy\nengaging their parents in discussion.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>It is unfortunate that children who do not relate well with their\nparents at home have friends and mates with whom they discuss issues\nconfronting them. This reveals that there is no avenue for parentchild\ncommunication in their homes. As Christian parents therefore,\nwe are encouraged to engage our children in discussion - not only on\nissues that concern their life and academics, but also about our lives\ntoo, within the frame that their intelligence can accomodate.<\/p>\n\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>An adage says, \u201cchildren grow fast\u201d. How true is\nit? Discuss. What attitudes do some parents put up before their\nchildren especially when they have challenges?<\/h5>\n\n\t\t<h5><b>Relating with the Children as they Grow<\/b><\/h5>\n\t\t<p>It is a gross mistake for parents to think that their life is totally\nhidden from their children. Parents have the sacred duty to show\nchildren the values and virtues they should imbibe \u2013 honesty,\nindustry, friendliness, holiness, selflessness, etc. Not only are\nparents to teach these values and virtues, they are also to live\nthem out. These attributes are truly more caught than taught. So it\nis a principle of \u201cdo as I do, not do as I say\u201d.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Furthermore, as they grow, especially at school age, parents are\nto prove to their children that they love and care for them by providing\nfor their school \u2013 fees, uniform and books; being with them at school\nfunctions, encouraging them in their performances, etc. Parents should\nalso endeavour to take their children to school either in their car or by\npublic transport themselves rather than leave them for the nanny or\nschool bus to take them to and bring them from school.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>As they grow into entering the higher institution, parents should\nbe there for the children. Let them know your ability as you provide\nthem basic necessities within your financial capacity. Walk and work\nwith them in their academic struggles. Call on them occasionally, or\npay them unannounced visits. This will enable children build\nconfidence in their parents and carry them along in critical moments\nof decision making, career choice, and marriage partnership which\nare major milestones in their lives. Another very important area of\nrelating well with children is for parents to lead them to Christ\npersonally. This will make them see their parents as their mentor,\nrole-model and discipler. The truth is, in no distant time, the children\nwill begin to emulate their parents\u2019 life-style.<\/p>\n\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time: <\/b>What attitude do some parents put up when children\ndiscuss some of their life issues with them especially in the area\nof marriage?<\/h5>\n\n\t\t<h5><b>Some Practical Steps Parents Can Take to Relate Well with\nChildren<\/b><\/h5>\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Be nice: <\/b>Parent should love their children and do their best to\ncreate a good and lasting impression in the mind of the children.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Be a giver and be kind: <\/b>A saying goes thus: \u201ccome for biscuit,\ncome for yam, makes a child associate with you\u201d.

Everybody\nis aging; after all, we grow every day. In fact, we have grown more\nthan we were last week, month or year. However, we are talking\nabout our aging parents. A lot of us have parents who are well\nadvanced in years, probably in their seventies or eighties. How do\nwe relate with them in accordance with the Scriptures that enjoins\nus to honour our parents so that our days may be long on the face\nof the earth?<\/p>\n\t\t<p>To be aging also means to be growing weak physically. That is,\nas we grow, our strength reduces. It is not possible for someone to\nbe physically strong in the 70s and 80s the way he\/she was in the\n40s. In essence, it means that one may not be able to do menial\njobs, run fast or eat as much as he used to. In addition, aging\nreduces a person\u2019s mental alertness. Also, certain features and\norgans in the body will stop functioning well. The book of\nEcclesiastes 3: 1-7 confirms this. While parents are conscious of\nthis fact, children should also be sensitive to cater for the needs\nand care of aging parents.<\/p>\n\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>Explain ways of caring for aging parents?<\/h5>\n\n\t\t<h5><b>What are the Basic Needs of Aging Parents?<\/b><\/h5>\n\t\t<p>There are some needs that are basic with aging parents \u2013\nphysical, psychological and emotional, relational, financial,\nsupportive needs, etc. Let\u2019s discuss a few of them:<\/p>\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Physical Needs:<\/b>As our parents get older, their physical strength\nreduces, hence, they need to be supported in the area of physical\nactivities. A woman helped her first daughter to nurse her children.\nBy the time the children grew up and were about to enter the higher\ninstitution, the woman could no longer do anything on her own;\nthereby needing help for the tasks that had become difficult. This\nalso applies to men. Studies have shown that men decline in physical\nstrength much earlier than women.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Psycho-emotional Needs:<\/b>As our parents grow older, we need to\nunderstand and appreciate the fact that what excited them while\nthey were much younger may not do so again. Thus, we must realise\nthat they need care. We must get closer to them, listen to their\nplights and make them happy and appreciated. That is why it is\nrequired that we should be very sensitive to what they say or do.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Relational Needs:<\/b>This is exactly what the topic is all about. Aging\nparents should not be abandoned. Africa is unlike the western world\nwhere the government provides elderly or old people\u2019s homes where\nthey are kept and nurtured. So, it is required of children to seek\nafter the welfare of their parents. We should cultivate the habit of\npaying them visit regularly, spending quality time with them, caring\nfor them when they are sick or bringing them into our homes as\nthe occasion demands. In doing this, they will feel loved, happy\nand live longer.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Financial Needs:<\/b>Majority of parents in their seventies and above\nhave retired or can no longer work as before. Thus, they depend\nmore on their children for financial support. As Christians, we should\nknow that the financial responsibility of aging parents is our\nresponsibility. We should not wait until they beg or ask before we\nsupport them financially. It is unfortunate today, in Nigeria, that\nmany elderly retired parents do not have their pensions paid on \ntime, and yet their children and families are also unemployed or\nunderemployed. This has made taking care of their parents\nfinancially become a serious challenge. May God deliver our nation\nfrom this economic mess in Jesus name.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Medical Need:<\/b>As parents age, they develop some medical\nconditions that call for regular attention and care. It is good for\nadult children to recognise this and be there to help. It does not\nmatter whether the parents stay with them or not. It is important\nfor children to take good care of their parents medically,. This will\nenable them enjoy their old age gracefully. We must not wait until\nthey die before we do the necessary.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\n\t\t<h5><b>Church Ministries to the Aging<\/b><\/h5>\n\t\t<p>The church should not be left out in the care for the aging. The church\u2019s\nresponsibility to the aging is enormous. The church is divided into\nvarious units and ministries for the purpose of ministering to the\nphysical and spiritual needs of people. All units or ministries within\nthe church should have plans or programmes in their activities to\nminister to the aging in the church. They can organise the aging into\nsenior adults club or senior citizens fellowship. When these fellowships\nare organised, members of this age group will have the opportunity of\ninteracting together, sharing their life experiences, encourage one\nanother, give counsel to one another if there is need for it, play, chat,\ndiscuss and fellowship together.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>As said earlier, some of them are prone to developing some\nphysical ailments; the church could organise medical outreaches\/\nclinics where they could receive free medical check-ups and offer\nthem some basic routine drugs needed and possibly involve\nmembers of their families for more and greater medical care.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Also, the church can engage the service of the elderly with\nspecial skills. As we all know that experience comes with age,\nafter they retire from their paid jobs, they can become useful\ninstruments in the church. Examples are: doctors, nurses, matrons,\nengineers, who can be asked to handle or supervise some\nassignments in the church. Some of them can assist church leaders\nas counselors and advisers. This way, the church is making them\nfeel wanted and needed and that further keeps them growing\nspiritually and glowing as they age.<\/p>\n\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time: <\/b>Does your church have ministry to the aged?<\/h5>  \n <!-- BODY CONTENT HERE -->     \n      \n\n        <!-- END OF EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD -->\n\n        <h4> Facilitator\\'s Closing Remarks <\/h4>\n        <p> This is great!

In a nutshell, both families\nbecome one big family as a result of the coming together of the\ncouple. One major reason why this discussion is crucial is because\nmany people are facing serious challenges in relating with their\nin-laws which should not to be. All relationships are based on\nprinciples and as someone rightly observed, when our principles\nare right, our practice will be right. What do I mean? For a wife, the\nprinciples are love, respect, and acceptance.<\/p>\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Love:<\/b>As Christians, we are to love one another. Definitely, a wife\nshould love her husband. If indeed she loves her husband, then\nshe should love her in-laws too. Unfortunately, many wives today\nseem to be possessive of their husband and home. A wife should\nlove her in-laws (her husband\u2019s father, mother, sisters and brothers)\nand even everyone that she knows to be her husband\u2019s relations\nwith the love of Christ.<\/li>\t\n\t\t\t<li><b>Respect:<\/b>The fact remains that respect is part of African culture.\nDuring courtship, most parents try to observe the character and\nattitude of their son\u2019s wife-to-be. The moment they observe that\nshe lacks courtesy and respect, their opinion forms the basis of\ntheir relationship with her. In the African setting, a wife does not\nin all cases call her husband by name, they share pet-name. In like\nmanner, the wife finds pet names for her husband\u2019s siblings, male \nand female, whether she is older or younger than they. Furthermore,\nshe would relate with her husband\u2019s parents as hers too. This is\nwhere respect begets respect. Naturally, Christians are to be humble\nand respectful even so a wife to her in-laws.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Acceptance:<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>This is a major area of conflict in in-law relationships.\nDue to differences in social class, family background, ethnicity, etc.\nsometimes, certain in-laws are unacceptable to themselves. But be\nthat as it may, the moment a man and a woman are joined as husband\nand wife, the natural thing a wife should do is to accept her in-laws. In\nreturn, her in-laws will welcome her into the family and make her feel\nfree whether her husband is around or not. A wife should accept her\nhusband\u2019s siblings as hers, and relate with them as she relates with\nher own. A situation where a wife feels that \u201cit is me and my husband\nand children\u201d; she would not enjoy her marriage. Marriage does not\nwork in isolation. Marriage associates us with people of likes and\ndislikes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>When a wife relates with her in-laws with love and respect,\nand accept them the way they are, she has a lot to gain, beginning\nfrom her husband\u2019s absolute affection and admiration.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\n\n\t\t<h5><b>In-Laws Relationship from the Perspective of a Husband<\/b><\/h5>\n\t\t<p>Let me just share Dr. Bill Maiers\u2019 opinion on how to relate with inlaws\nand vice-versa before I share few other thoughts as Africans.\nMaier\u2019s instruction to parents\u2019 in-law is as follows:<\/p>\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li>Do not give advice unless the young couple specifically ask for it.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Keep your personal questions to a minimum. Remember, a\ncouple\u2019s primary allegiance should be to each other, not to\neither set of parents. The new couple need privacy in order to\ndevelop a meaningful relationship.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Respect the couple\u2019s confidence when they confide in you.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Do not expect the new couple to live according to your standards\nand values. Allow them to develop their own family traditions.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Treat the couple with respect. Do not belittle them or their decision.\nThey may have\/need a lot to learn, but they need to learn these\nlessons by themselves. Allow them to make their own mistakes\nand do not adopt an \u201cI-told-you-so\u201d attitude if they fail.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Take a genuine interest in your in-law as a person. Seek to relate\nwith your in-law in a meaningful way and on his or her terms.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Do not treat your in-law as a rival who has stolen your child\u2019s love.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t<p>As a matter of fact, as mummy said a while ago, it is a matter\nof principles and the basic thing is to build a positive relationship.\nThe way we do this, according to Whitney Hopler is to:<\/p>\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li>Choose to act in love.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Be patient with all.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Daughter in-law, be a blessing to your mother-in-law.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Mother-in-law, be a blessing to your daughter-in-law.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t<p>Better put, mothers-in-law should lead by letting go and\ndaughters-in-law should choose to respect. Let me also add that\nmen (husbands) should pray for grace for a large heart and trust\nGod for provision. Relating well as children of God calls for wisdom,\nmaturity, understanding and some level of openness, and of course\nwith all its attendant boundaries.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Let me advice young people, as our mother said a while ago,\ntreat your in-laws with sincere love, respect and acceptance. Very\nsoon, you\u2019ll become parents-in-law and your children brothers or\nsisters-in-law. Remember the principle, \u201cWe reap what we sow\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\t\t<h5><b>Benefits of Relationship with In-laws<\/b><\/h5>\n\t\t<p>It is important to keep your relationship with your in-laws intact\nfor co-existence and harmony. Set aside time, or ask in-laws for\ntime out with them. It is important to keep the lines of\ncommunication open whenever you are relating with your in-laws.\nSuccessful relationships depend on good, open communication.\nYour children will gain a unique and valuable bond with their\ngrandparents, because they will also see them and relate with them\nas you parents relate with them. As you relate with your in-laws,\nyou will possibly get many chances of helping and making them\nbetter people. Your relationship with in-laws will determine how\nmuch time you will have with them as they age gracefully and this\ncan possibly be the memories you will cherish forever.<\/p>\n <!-- BODY CONTENT HERE -->     \n      \n\n        <!-- END OF EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD -->\n\n        <h4> Facilitator\\'s Closing Remarks <\/h4>\n        <p>Wow!

This division\nimpedes the success of the Church in fulfilling the Great\nCommission because work is seen as a means of keeping a meal\nticket.

He had a specific motive for\ndoing so. It was and is still embedded in the idea of work. The\npurpose of what God did in Genesis 1:28 is expressed in Genesis\n2:15 \u201cand the Lord God made man and put him in the garden to\nwork it and to keep it,\u201d to sustain God\u2019s creation. The first basis for\nwork is known as the \u2018Creation Mandate\u2019 (Genesis 1:27-30). This\nmandate revealed man as being called to have dominion over the\nearth. Man was made in God\u2019s image, to be steward of the earth,\ndesigned to be \u201cgood\u201d, like all of creation. The pre-fall account\nreveals God as the owner of everything (Psalms 8:3-6; 24:1). It\nunveils two institutions: work\/business and marriage and man\nfunctions in them as a steward, having responsibilities on all things\nand accountable to God (Genesis 2:8, 15; Ecclesiastes 9:10). Our\nrole as stewards has made us caretakers working for His good\npleasure. Some stewards have more responsibilities than the others\n(Matthew 25:15-18). The summary of the creation mandate is\nSTEWARDSHIP. Stewardship says we own nothing and that\neverything in our possession is for the benefit of others, they are\ntherefore meant to be given away:<\/p>\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li>Power and authority \u2013 to equip others<\/li>\t\n\t\t\t<li>Money and wealth \u2013 to bless others<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Wisdom, strength & health \u2013 to work and serve others<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Influence and position \u2013 to serve and resource people<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t<p>The fall of man depicted in Genesis 3 generated a change in the \n\t\tnature of work. In response to Adam\u2019s sin, God pronounced\nseveral judgments (Genesis 3:17-19), the most severe of which\nis death. However, God\u2019s pronouncement of labour and its\nresults is reflected centrally in the rest of the judgments. God\ncursed the ground, not man nor work. Work became difficult,\nyet productive. The word \u2018toil\u2019 is used, and it implies challenge,\ndifficulty, exhaustion, and struggle. Work in itself is good, but\nman must accomplish it by \u201cthe sweat of his brow.\u201d In addition,\nthe fact is, the result will not always be positive. Although man\nwill eat the plants of the field, the field will also produce thorns\nand thistles. Hard work and effort may not always be rewarded\nin the way the labourer expects or desires.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>In addition, we need to note that when the ground was cursed,\nman was made to eat from the produce of the field, not from the\nGarden of Eden. The Garden of Eden is symbolic of an earthly\nparadise made by God with a safe enclosure. It also symbolises\npurity and innocence. The earth or field, on the other hand,\nrepresents an unbounded, unprotected space and there was an\nemphasis on worldliness. Therefore, the work environment can be\nhostile, especially to Christians (Genesis 39:1-23; Exodus 1:8-22;\nNehemiah 4) because man is no longer living in the Garden of\nEden but on the field.<\/p>\n\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>How can we perform our work as stewards of\nopportunities and what difference should we make in our world?<\/h5>\n\n\n\t\t<h5><b>The Redemption Mandate of Work<\/b><\/h5>\n\t\t<p>After Adam and Eve fell, work became a burden (Genesis 3:17-\n20). Man had benefittedso much from his work. For example, Adam\u2019s\nnaming of the creatures in Genesis 2:19-20 revealed that Adam\ncalled them the names they bear till now. He had unhindered access\ninto the mind of God, and called them the names God had in mind.\nHe worked with enormous ease. However, after the fall, work\nbecame a burden, toil and labour. However, work was not cursed\nbut the ground (Genesis 3:17).<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The story did not end with the fall of man; Christ later came\nand communicated the redemption mandate which is the Great\nCommission (Matthew 28:19-20). In this mandate, man is called\nto witness Christ and partner with Him. The redemption mandate\ndoes not abdicate the creation; rather it reaffirms the original\nintention of the Creator through the two institutions \u2013 work and\nmarriage; and then goes further to add two other institutions:\ngovernment and Church.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Government exists for:<\/p>\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li>organising initiatives for the well-being and safety of people;<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>setting limits and standards (laws) for people to live and work;\nand<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>maintaining justice by punishing wrong-doers.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t<p>The Church exists to:<\/p>\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li>train believers for the work of the ministry;<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>commission those called to work in other God ordained\ninstitutions;<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>spread the Good News;<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>serve as the presence of God\u2019s rule on earth;<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>be the light to the world;<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>act as an agent of reconciliation between God and man.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t<p>The redemption mandate unveils Christ\u2019s work on the cross as\nredeeming man from his fallen state and reconnecting him to the\noriginal intention of the Creator. It tells of God\u2019s intention of\nreclaiming this fallen world and rescuing the sinner through His\nSon, Jesus Christ (Genesis 3:15; Romans 8:19-22); desiring that no\none be lost but come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9). It emphasises\nthat salvation affects everything about us \u2013 our relationships,\ncharacter and our conducts (Colossians 3:17). Whatever we do\nwhile we are on earth has eternal consequences (Matthew 25:31-\n46). Through Christ, we are restored to God and work becomes a\nblessing, purposeful, profitable and pleasing to God.<\/p>\n\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>Lead members to discuss how believers can be\nstewards in their callings as partners with God.<\/h5>\n <!-- BODY CONTENT HERE -->     \n      \n\n        <!-- END OF EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD -->\n\n        <h4> Facilitator\\'s Closing Remarks <\/h4>\n        <p>The right worldview of work as viewed from biblical standpoint is\nthat work is a ministry before God and with God.

Therefore, Genesis\n2:15 is the summary of the purpose for man\u2019s presence in the\ngarden, to work in it and keep it. How can man connect with this\npurpose without understanding it in the first place? How can man\neffectively function in the administrative working capacity without\ngetting a firm grip of the implications of work from the Creator\u2019s\nstandpoint? This is the crux of our study today. Let us journey along.<\/p>  <!-- Facilitator\\'s remarks here-->\n        \n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD <\/h4> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->       \n        \n        <ol type=\"A\">\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD -->\n        \n        \n        <li>\n        <h5><b>God\u2019s Big Picture<\/b><\/h5> <!-- SUB TOPIC --> <!--  EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD TITLE -->\n\t\t<p>To understand God\u2019s idea of work holistically, we need to know\nwho God is, what He is doing and how He wants humankind to\ncollaborate with Him. The origin of work is depicted in the book of\nGenesis. The opening words of the Bible revealed God as a worker;\nbusy with the creation of the world (Genesis 1:1) and even to the\nfinal words in the Bible, God is still seen as a worker; creating a\nnew heaven and a new earth. God first did work on earth. He worked\nfor six days and rested on the seventh day. Consequently, legitimate\nwork reflects God\u2019s purposeful activity because God is inherently\ngood, and whatever He does is good including work (Psalm 25:8;\nEphesians 4:28). The way we view God and work determines how\nwe function with God and do our work. If God is seen as a worker\nand work is seen as God\u2019s institution, we will relate with Him in\nthat understanding. This will enable us carry out our work in God\u2019s\nway and not contrary to God\u2019s plan and purpose.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>This is the substance of a biblical theology of work. Theology\nof work has been defined as the study of God (the Trinity) as\nworkers, and how we need to adopt their values, emulate their\nactions and follow their instructions as they apply to our lives.\nConsequently, biblical \u201cTheology of Work\u201d is the believer\u2019s attempt\nto understand how to integrate the \u201cpurposeful activity (work)\u201d\nwe are engaged in with the practice of our faith; i.e., our belief in\nthe person and mission of God. It is the study of how God works\nand how He views work. Furthermore, Genesis 1:31 declares that,\nwhen God saw all that He had created, He saw that it was \u201cvery\ngood.\u201d God examined and assessed the quality of His work, and\nwhen He saw that He had done a good job, He took pleasure in the\noutcome. By this example, it is apparent that work should be\nproductive, satisfactory and fulfilling. Work should be carried out\nin such a way that it will produce the highest quality result.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>God created man in His image with same characteristics as\nHis (Genesis 1:26-31). He created man to work in partnership with\nHim in the world; to cultivate and maintain it (Genesis 2:8, 15).\nAdditionally, Adam and Eve were to subdue and rule over the earth.\nThis original work of man was to cultivate, meaning to foster growth,\nimprove, maintain and to preserve from failure or decline. To subdue\nmeans to exercise control and discipline. To rule over means to\nadminister, take responsibility of, and make decisions. Looking at\nthese preceding purposes for creation, they find expression through\nall vocations. That is, there is no vocation that cannot be embarked\nupon in this framework.<\/p>\n\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>How does God\u2019s purpose for creation find expression\nin your own vocation?<\/h5>\n\n\n\t\t<h5><b>God\u2019s Unending Big Picture<\/b><\/h5>\n\t\t<p>The New Testament opens with the revelation of some primary\ncharacters serving as manual labourers. Jesus was \u201ca carpenter\u201d; some\ndisciples were fishermen, a tax collector, a physician; and Paul was a\ntentmaker. Jesus identified with various categories of workers and the\nidea of work through His parables. Most of Jesus\u2019 parables were weaved\naround work and workers. He placed premium on purposeful work.\nFurthermore, the Bible encourages diligent work for all able-bodied\npeople and condemns idleness even while anticipating the coming of\nJesus Christ (Colossians 3:23; 2 Thessalonians 3:10). This view of work\nwas the prevailing Christian attitude for the first century after the\napostles. Unfortunately, as time evolved, the early church fathers created\na disparity between secular work and religious or sacred work. The\nreformation made \u2018vocation\u2019 a universal term, and was applicable to all\nstates of life and all kinds of work. Whereas, all work were to be regarded\nas a service to God. In principle, all kinds of work are \u2018holy,\u2019 so far they \nare performed in faith, in love and in obedience to God. By implication,\nall work, sacred and secular, intellectual and manual, were avenues of\nserving God. Work should be an integration of faith into daily living\u2014a\nholistic lifestyle\u2014where all awareness, activity, work and enjoyment\nhas the purpose of honouring and glorifying God. The big picture in the\nmind of God as revealed in the New Testament characters emphasised\ndiligence in their work, their stewardship of God\u2019s call, and their purpose\nto serve God and the society.<\/p>\n\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>What is your view of this statement\u201dWork should\nbe an integration of faith into daily living\u2014a holistic lifestyle\u2014\nwhere all awareness, activity, work and enjoyment has the purpose\nof honouring and glorifying God\u201d?<\/h5>\n\n\t\t<h5><b>Fulfilling the Big Picture<\/b><\/h5>\n\t\t<p>In today\u2019s society, there are two extreme attitudes toward work.\nThe first makes too little of work, while the second makes too much\nof work. Work is viewed by some as a necessary evil, or something\nto be avoided in order to maximise their leisure time. Although\nthey want to make as much money as they can, they still express\ndesire to work as little as possible and make much profit. This\nattitude leads to other forms of immorality in the workplace such\nas the evasion of tax, absenteeism, taking the company\u2019s property\nhome as personal. On the other extreme, others idolize work and\nderive their identity and security from their work. They can afford\nto work long hours at the expense of other important things such\nas their family, relationships, and church activities.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The correct approach to work is that work should be viewed\nfrom the Creator\u2019s perspective. Our text for today unveils man as a\ntool in God\u2019s hand. Remember that the redemption mandate serves\nas a re-creation platform for our new nature in Christ which \nvalidates our relationship with God and repositions us to fulfil His\noriginal intention at creation. It then suffices to say that man is a\ntool in God\u2019s hand for the attainment of His purpose. Thus, man is\nsaved from the hold of sin to be a tool in a toolbox for fixing the\nsociety. The variety of tools in a toolbox is symbolic of the diversity\nthat exists among believers. Each member is unique and peculiar\nin ability, capacity and function. In essence, God envisaged a world\nthat needs to be maintained and sustained successively, and then\nHe made man as a tool for achieving this purpose, placing in Him\nin strategic places in the society.<\/p>\n\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>Lead members to discuss how their work connects\nwith God\u2019s big picture at creation.<\/h5>\n <!-- BODY CONTENT HERE -->     \n      \n\n        <!-- END OF EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD -->\n\n        <h4> Facilitator\\'s Closing Remarks <\/h4>\n        <p>Our understanding of work must be shaped by the revelation of\nGod\u2019s mind as contained in the Bible.

This conviction\nmust be based on who God is, who humans are, the history\nand the nature of the Church, the meaning of Jesus\u2019 death and\nresurrection, the purpose of Jesus\u2019 message about the Kingdom\nand His ongoing work on earth. Conviction means having an\ninner witness that drives a passion to do a particular thing.\nConviction refers to the state of being convinced and confident\nthat something is true; a strong persuasion or belief. In other\nwords, conviction stands opposed to doubt and skepticism.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Believers who will work in an acceptable manner must believe\nthat their work is a ministry both to God and humanity. They\nmust see their work as a calling and as the very purpose for\nwhich they were created. A man of conviction is one who will\nnaturally have the drive for super action. A person\u2019s convictions\nwill make him have a definite impact in terms of how he lives,\nwhat he does, says, and where he goes. Thus, a man of conviction\nis one whose convictions are derived from the Scriptures and is\nliving rightly and effectively.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Commitment<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The second step towards acceptable work is that those who\ncollaborate with God to fulfil His purpose on earth are people\nwho are committed. To be committed is to have the willingness\nto give your time and energy to something that you believe in,\nor having a firm decision to do something. The work of God in\nour hands is something we must give all the attention it\ndemands from us. Our commitment to it must be topnotch and\ntop-rated. Whatever work we do should take priority of our time \nand we must put in all the effort and energy it demands to\nensure things go well as they should. The idea that \u201cI cannot\nkill myself because of this work\u201d should not be expressed\namong God\u2019s people, having it in mind that we are working\nwith God in His ministry. We must always give our best to the\nwork we do and be incurably committed to it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Competence<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The third step towards engaging in a work acceptable to God\nis that the worker is competent. Let us use the word excellence\nas a synonym for competence to drive home a salient point. As\nwe earlier established that God is the first Worker on the surface\nof the earth, His work is characterised by excellence: \u201cAnd God\nsaw everything He had made, and behold it was very good\u2026\u201d\n(Genesis 1:31). Competence is a virtue that is lacking among\nmany believers today. Many Christians work with high sense\nof mediocrity and sub-standardization. We must continually\nremind ourselves that as collaborators with God, we must imbibe\nand reflect His trait of excellence in all we do. As we can\nenhance the virtue of competence by sharpening our skill and\nability through training and practice at every given opportunity,\nso does it also require depending on the power of the Holy\nSpirit, the use of ministry gifts and diligence. One thing we \ncannot overemphasize is that our performance at work should\nmanifest and reflect the integrity and character of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Character<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The fourth step towards engaging in acceptable work is the\npossession of Christ-like character. When Paul listed the\nrequirements for Christian leadership and workmanship (1\nTimothy 4:6ff), one of the things he stressed is character. He\nemphasised the exhibition of self-control, hospitality,\ngentleness (control of anger), a quest for holiness, temperance,\ndying to the love of money, to manipulation and to always\nhaving it one\u2019s own way. Acceptable work and workers should\ncombine absolute loyalty to Christ and a burning desire to live\n\u201cabove reproach\u201d. Character is golden and priceless. It involves\nbeing a person of integrity and good reputation. Those who\ncollaborate with God to fulfil His purposes on earth must be\npeople whose words are their bond. They are people who are\ntransparent and sincere in the face of whatever challenge. While\nothers are compromising, they will not. The Bible warns against\nthe use of dishonest measures and unbalanced scales (Proverbs\n11:1). In giving quotations and submitting proposals for work,\npartners with God must avoid making excessive profit to the\ndetriment and exploitation of the client. Character serves a\nyardstick for measuring conviction, commitment, competence,\nhonesty and sincerity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>Discuss reasons believers find it difficult to maintain\ntheir identity in the market place.<\/h5>\n\t\t\n\n\t\t<h5><b>Divine Requirement<\/b><\/h5>\n\t\t<p>The Bible reveals that God does all things with competence\nand excellence (Genesis 1-2; Psalm 8; Psalm 150:2) and it matters\nto Him that humanity, created in His image should do their work\nwith excellence and competence too (Colossians 3:23-24;\nEcclesiastes 9:10; Hebrews 11:4; 1 Corinthians 12:31; Proverbs\n22:29; Daniel 6:3). In Exodus 31:1-6, Bezalel is described as a man\nfilled with the Spirit of God, who did excellent work for God. In like\nmanner, Christians ought to do all their work with excellence as\nthe Spirit of God resides and operates in them. Daniel and his friends\nalso did work with excellence such that the king noticed that they\nwere ten times better than all others were (Daniel 1:19-20). Daniel \ndistinguished himself with exceptional qualities and attitudes and\nwould not compromise with idolatry (Daniel 6:1-3). Joseph was an\nexcellent worker with a great attitude, who would not compromise\nwith immorality, and God promoted him. An excellent attitude is\ndesired (1 Corinthians 10:31; Colossians 3:23-24). But note that\nexcellence and competence takes hard work.<\/p>\n\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>Can people say about you that you meet divine\nrequirements in your workplace?<\/h5>\n\n <!-- BODY CONTENT HERE -->     \n      \n\n        <!-- END OF EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD -->\n\n        <h4> Facilitator\\'s Closing Remarks <\/h4>\n        <p>Requirements of an acceptable worker is encapsulated in the\nprinciple of the revelation of the knowledge of God\u2019s Word and\nthis should constitute the fabric of our work principles.

From that time, the survival of man was\ndependent on his own sweat as against being sustained by grace.\nThereafter, Jesus came to reveal work as a call to witness Christ\nand expand His kingdom (Matthew 28:19-20). While the creation \nmandate predates and predefines work, the redemption mandate,\nwhich is built on and around the mission of Jesus Christ, offers a\nnew paradigm for work without distorting the creation mandate.\nThis mandate emphasises that work and workers are tools in the\nachievement of God\u2019s agenda of His kingdom to come on earth, as\nit is in heaven.<\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s remarks here-->\n        \n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD <\/h4>\n\t\t<p>Many believers often think that for them to be involved in God\u2019s\nwork, they have to quit their job.

In the New\nTestament, ministry is seen as service to God and to other people.\nEvery believer is called to serve God and humanity according to\nthe measure of grace and ability God has deposited in them.

Man\u2019s duty is to \u201cwork,\ntake care of, administer, be a steward of all that God had created\u201d.\nBy implication, man is a steward, who is to rule over, subdue, and\nwork. He is to play the role of a watchman and be the guard of\nGod\u2019s creation on His behalf.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Jesus provided the pattern for Christian ministry\u2014He came, not\nto be served, but to serve (see Matthew 20:28; Mark 10:45; John\n13:1-17). Ministry can, and should include ministering to the physical,\nemotional, mental, vocational, and financial needs of others. Thus\nChristians are ministers and have the responsibility of meeting\npeople\u2019s needs with love and humility on Christ\u2019s behalf (see Matthew\n20:26; Mark 10:43; John 2:5,9; Acts 6:3; Romans 1:1; Galatians 1:10;\nColossians 4:12). Christians are to carry out ministry out of devotion\nto Christ and love for others, whether they are believers or\nunbelievers. Ministering to others should be impartial and\nunconditional, always seeking to help others as Jesus would.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Ministry is not only limited to spiritual services rendered in\nchurch, it also involves every work done in harmony with God for\nthe good of humanity.

God has a clear perspective on\nthe kind of attitude that should underpin human work; and believers\nare to align their thoughts and actions with His. The following\nprinciples reveal the mind of God for and about work:<\/p> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->       \n        \n        <ol type=\"A\">\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD -->\n        \n       <li><b>Work is Ordained by God<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Apart from marriage, work is another institution ordained by\nGod. God did not only ordain work, He is also the first worker.\nAll through the Bible, God is seen working. Work was God\u2019s\ncreative invention from the beginning (Genesis 1). By working,\nwe have a likeness of God. Just like God, we have the ability to\nwork, make plans, implement them, and be creative.\nAdditionally, God gave us the task of ruling over and taking\ncare of His creation (Genesis 1:28; 2:15).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Work is for a Lifetime<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>God\u2019s intention is for humanity to work as long as they live. By\nthe sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the\nground (Genesis 319). By implication, if work is seen as a\nministry opportunity and there is no disparity between sacred\nand secular work, humanity will work till death, not because\nthey want to keep a meal ticket but because their partnership\nin what God is doing, is like the marital vow - \u2018till death do us\npart.\u2019 In the sight of God, there is no retirement as long as work\nis seen as ministry.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Work is neither a Punishment nor a Curse<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>God did not institute work as a means to keep man under\n\t\t\t\tpressure, oppressed or make him do unrewarding labour; but\nas a gift of fulfilment and productive activity. Humankind can\nonly find satisfaction in his work to the extent to which he sees\nhis work as a gift from God(Ecclesiastes 2:24-25).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Work is a Purposeful Activity<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Work is done to glorify God (1 Corinthians 10:31); to meet personal\nand family needs (1 Thessalonians 4:11-12); to help others in need\n(Ephesians 4:28); to benefit, sustain and transform the society (Isaiah\n42:5-6); to fulfil the Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20); and for\npersonal fulfilment (Ecclesiastes 2:24).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Work Requires Submission and Obedience<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>All workers must see God as the overall boss who delegates\nresponsibility to earthly bosses to undertake on His behalf.\nThus, even when the overall boss is not watching, a good and\nbiblical worker is consistent and diligent to the task and loyal\nto the organization (Colossians 3:22). Notwithstanding,\nemployers should treat employees with dignity, respect and\nfairness. Our responsibility at work is primarily to God and\nsecondarily to man.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Work Should be done with Excellence<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Excellence should be the hallmark and trademark of every work\ndone by a disciple of Christ. Jesus spent 30 years of His earthly\nministry as a carpenter and it is not recorded that He underdelivered\nor had issues with His clients. He was excellent in\nwork and character. Disciples of Christ are to render service,\nas to the Lord, and not to men, not to be men-pleasers but\nGod-pleasers(Ephesians 6:6-7). God\u2019s standard of excellence\nis what we should crave for.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Work is Honorable and Dignifying<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>All legal and biblically ethical professions are honorable and\ndignifying before the Lord. There is no dichotomy or disparity\nbetween sacred and secular work and no work is more important\nthan the other so long as they bring glory to God. Work that is\ndone in partnership with God results in social transformation\nas well as fulfilment to the worker, are equally important to\nGod (1 Corinthians 10:31). Deuteronomy 24:14 declares, \u201dDo\nnot take advantage of a hired man.\u201d In God\u2019s eyes, work is much\nmore than employment. Work is a divine calling and part of\nGod\u2019s plan for the development of the world He created. The\nGod-ordained aspects of human work go beyond compensation,\nculture, and occupation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Work Provides an Opportunity for Kingdom Witness<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Saint Francis of Assisi said \u201cpreach the gospel always, when\nnecessary, use words\u201d. The various platforms for work offer\nbelievers the opportunity to manifest a powerful message, both\nverbal and nonverbal, of a supernatural approach to work. The\nworld is in need of powerful witnesses to the transforming power\nof Christ; and our work offers such profound opportunities\n(Matthew 5:16).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>Work is Worship<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The Hebrew word \u2018Avodah\u2019 is used in the beginning chapters of\nGenesis to mean \u201cwork\u201d (Genesis 2:5) and a few verses later,\nAvodah is used again as work (Genesis 2:15; Genesis 4:2).\nHowever, the same word Avodah was also translated elsewhere\nin the Old Testament as worship (Exodus 8:1 and Psalm 100:2).\nBy this two in one expression, God is connecting the realm of\nwork with the realm of worship. When work is done God\u2019s way,\nwork and worship share the same spiritual value. Both are Godpleasing\nacts of divine service. To God, Avodah is Avodah\nwhether in the context of your workplace, your church, or\nsomewhere else.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><b>God Equips His People for their Work<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Because of the value God places on work and the place it\noccupies in His purposes, God does not just send His people to\nwork without adequate preparation. He equips them spiritually,\nmentally and intellectually for good and impactful works\n(Exodus 31:2-11). Meaningful work cannot be done without\npreparation and empowerment for it. Adequate preparation\nguarantees maximum performance at work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>Discuss how the above mentioned principles can\nbe applied to daily work.<\/h5>\n\n <!-- BODY CONTENT HERE -->     \n      \n\n        <!-- END OF EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD -->\n\n        <h4> Facilitator\\'s Closing Remarks <\/h4>\n        <p>Work can never be fulfilling if it is not done according to the mind of\nGod.

In Genesis, God is seen at work, and how God intends His\npeople to work is revealed. Any discussion of work in biblical\nperspective eventually finds itself grounded on passages in this\nbook and runs through other books of the Bible. Genesis is\nincomparably significant for the Theology of Work because it tells\nthe story of God\u2019s work of creation, the first work of all and the\nprototype for all work that follows. The created universe that God\nbrings into existence then provides the material of human work\u2014\nspace, time, matter and energy. Within the created universe, God\nis in a relationship with his creatures and especially with people;\nlabouring in God\u2019s image, working in creation, on creation, with\ncreation and\u2014working as God intends\u2014for creation.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>As disciples of Jesus Christ, we must know that work is a vital\npart of our stewardship, our worship and our calling.

When\nsuch happens, the relationship is in dire need of bridges for\nrestoration to take place. God saw the need to restore man into\nHimself, so He sent Jesus as the Bridge between us. However, He\ndid not stop there. He commissioned us to the ministry of\nconnecting men to God.

They planned to build a tower that its top\nwould reach heaven so they could live together. This was not\nGod\u2019s plan for man.

Being a bridge builder calls for the\ntransformation of the mind. According to the passage we read, the\nlifestyle of a bridge builder is characterised by:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Sacrifice (v. 13) -<\/b>A bridge builder must live a sacrificial life. We are\nto live with the readiness of going out of our comfort zones to restore\nrelationships. We need to give up ourselves to God\u2019s service and\nrisk our lives to be bridge builders (1 Corinthians 9: 19). It is\nunfortunate that many believers today are not ready to be bridge\nbuilders because it is a task that could be messy sometimes.It may\ninvolve relating with people who are considered as outcasts and as\na result, lose the friendship of certain people in our lives. For instance,\nPeter had been eating with the Gentiles in Antioch, but when other\nJews arrived, he was faced with the choice of either sacrificing his\npersonal reputation or drawing back (Galatians 2:11-13). Though it\nmay be difficult, but we should remember that Jesus, the ultimate\nBridge Builder also paid the ultimate sacrifice (His life).<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Surrender (v. 14) -<\/b>Bridge builders do not see the ministry as\noptional but as a divine obligation to be carried out irrespective\nof their own personal reservations. They do not need to be\ncompelled, urged, and persuaded before carrying out the divine\nmandate. They are propelled by Christ\u2019s love; through His death\non the cross and soon realise that they can do no less for others.\nBuilding bridges may be difficult or against our desire. We may\nhave to restore a friendship, though we are the ones who are\nhurt. We must be willing to surrender to Christ\u2019s love above\nour desire as Jesus said on the cross \u201c\u2026yet not my will but\nyours be done\u201d(Luke 22:42).<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Seeing Things Differently (v. 16, 17) -<\/b>A bridge builder must\nbe ready to see things through the eyes of faith, not from human\npoint of view. A bridge builder should trust in God\u2019s power to\ntransform, and make things whole. Remember that Christ gave\nup Himself to die for our sins and to save us from wrath.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Servanthood and Humility (v. 20) -<\/b>The Bible shows an\namazing picture of Jesus Christ submitting to the will of the\nFather, even till death. As believers, we must also do the will\nof Him who has called us into the ministry of reconciliation\nwith a humble heart. We must humbly lay down our position\nand pride as we seek to build bridges.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Spirit-filled (v. 19, 20) -<\/b>Jesus did not go about His ministry of\nbridge building by His own power. He sought God\u2019s power to\nsee Him through. We cannot be effective bridge builders if God\nis not in us. God dwells in us through the Holy Spirit. When we\nseek the power of the Holy Spirit to dwell in us, He will help us\nin all situations. Also, the Holy Spirit will enable us bear fruits\nsuch that we will become agents of change wherever we go.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>Share with members a time you sacrificed something\nprecious to restore your relationship with a friend or family member.<\/h5>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li><b>Principles for Building Bridges<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>In carrying out this assignment of building bridges, we need to\nkeep some unchanging principles in mind:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Obedience to God\u2019s Word:<\/b>A bridge builder must have the\nknowledge of God\u2019s word and obey it. The Bible contains all\nwe need to guide our thoughts and actions in bridge building.\nGod\u2019s word will help us build the foundation of our faith and\nteach us God\u2019s way. When we make the Word of God the\nfoundation of our lives, it would not be difficult to sustain our\nrelationships either with God or man. In restoring relationships\nbetween people, we must be careful not to bring them back\ntogether on the basis of lies, flattery, empty gestures or gifts\nthat give false appearance of a restored relationship; this will\nnot last but only bring future disaster.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Patience:<\/b>The ministry of bridge building needs patience. An\nexpectation of immediate resolution and restoration will make\nus frustrated since the assignment is a continuous one. A mighty\nbuilding does not always come up in a day. Whether it is in our\nrelationship with God or man, we must be ready to patiently\nwait. In fact, the more we patiently work on building bridges in\nrelationships, the stronger the relationships.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>A Right Heart:<\/b>While we go about building bridges especially\nwhen it concerns other people, we should be careful of the\nstate of our hearts.

This perfect relationship was the very essence of man.\nThe absence of this relationship means that there exists a great\nemptiness in man that can only be filled by a deep personal\nrelationship with God. Many try to fill this gap with things that\nonly informs human short-sightedness. Many others try to solve\nthe problem of sin in several other ways. Today, sin is still the\ngreatest source of separation between us and God. Not only does\nit blind us from the reality of God\u2019s power, it makes us hostile to\nHim. Like Adam, it also makes us to move away when God seeks\n(calls us) that we draw near to Him. Sin stains our conscience,\nmaking us afraid of God. While sin and its various manifestations\nprimarily break our relationship with God, other things exist for\nour separation from God which we must deal with.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Distrust of God (Lack of Faith):<\/b>Many believers lack faith in God\nand this hinders them from doing His will. The Bible reveals that\nanyone who draws near to God must believe that He exists (Hebrews\n11:6). This implies that the revelation of the existence of God stirs\nup faith in a believer. However, most people believe that God exists\nbut become separated from Him or remain so when they doubt His\ncharacter based on their experiences in life, false knowledge, etc.\nSome do not believe that God seeks a personal relationship with\nthem. This distrust and lack of faith becomes an obstacle to knowing\nGod and causes further separation from Him. No doubt, a\ndoubleminded person cannot access God (James 1:6-8).<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Wrong Understanding of God:<\/b>Wrong perceptions received from\nchurches, preachers, and backgrounds have pushed many people\naway from God. Some think that God demands perfection from\nthem, others feel since they are God\u2019s children they cannot\nexperience bad things. Also, they feel since God is good, then why\ndo the righteous suffer in the hands of evil people?If we have a\nwrong understanding of God, it will limit us in our pursuit of a\nrestored relationship with Him (Romans 10:1-3).<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>What other things do you think causes separation\nbetween us and God?<\/h5>\n\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t<li>What are some beliefs and opinions you had about God but\nwhich you have now found to be false?<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>In what ways have wrong beliefs pushed you or others\naround you away from God?<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\n\n\t\t\t<li><b>The Bridge<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Most people recognise how far away they are from God. They\nrecognise their great need for Him and desperately want to be\nreconnected to Him. As a result, they make several attempts to reach\nGod through diverse means. Verse 11 shows some of those attempts.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Sacrifices:<\/b>Under the old covenant, people tried to reach God\nthrough animal sacrifices, but they were not enough to free them\nfrom the shackles of sin. Today, some people still do the same\nthrough sacrifices of church attendance, good works, giving of\nofferings, alms and the likes. While all these are great, they are\nnot alternatives to reconnect us to God but things we should do\nout of our restored relationship with God.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Priests:<\/b>Some people have given up on reaching God.They have\nconcluded that it is impossible to reach God themselves and so put\ntheir hope in other people or works to reconnect them to God. Through\nthis means, many people have been deceived by false prophets,\nteachers, friends, pastors, etc.Even though there is a place for pastors,\nteachers and leaders in the church and they have the responsibility of\nspeaking the mind of God to us, they still are not the bridge that God\ndesigned. Many still try to draw near to God through several other\nreligious activities and so called \u201cspiritual\u201d exercises. The Bible reveals\nthat there is only one bridge we need - Jesus Christ.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>The Death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ:<\/b>What could not be\nachieved by years of human sacrifices was done by Jesus Christ\nthrough His blood (v. 14, 17-18). The Bible reveals that while Jesus\nwas on the cross, the veil of the temple was torn into two (Matthew\n27: 51). This signifies the access we have through Christ to the\nmost Holy Place, the innermost court, the dwelling of God\u2019s very\npresence. His blood was shed to make atonement for sin. After His\nmission on earth, Jesus ascended into heaven to sit at the righthand\nof God, and to prepare a place for us. Only those who put\ntheir trust in Him can gain access to God. Thus, the bridge to gain\naccess to God is Jesus Christ (Colossians 1:19, 20).<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>What are some other sacrifices that we make to please God?<\/h5>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li><b>Building the Bridge<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Having recognised the work of God through Jesus on the cross, we\nmust make a commitment to walk in this path. This will be shown\nin our readiness to:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Seek Forgiveness of Sin (v. 17-18):<\/b>Christ has made remission\nfor our sins so we can be washed clean and made perfect\nthrough His blood. However, we need to come to the throne of\ngrace to seek mercy and accept His offer. This is a step of faith\nin humility that all must take to approach God.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Live by Faith (v. 19-22):<\/b>Walking with God requires boldness\nand assurance of faith. The devil will seek to terminate our\nrelationship with God by making us to doubt the redemptive\nwork of Jesus Christ on the cross and the nature and commands\nof God. Only faith in God can help us to stand.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Friendship with God (v. 22):<\/b>The word of God encourages us\nto draw near to God. We are to follow Him closely through\ndeliberate relationship (James 4:8). We must move from seeing\nGod as a distant father to seeing Him as a loving Father who\ndesires a real personal relationship with us. The best way to\ndraw near to God is through obedience and trust. Jesus calls\nthose who obey His commands, friends.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Ultimately, God wants us to also reconcile others to Him. If we\ntruly love God, whatever is dear to His heart should be dear to us.\nHence, we are to make every effort to bridge the gap between\nthem and God through Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>Why do people find it hard to believe that God will\naccept them in spite of their unclean state and wash them clean\nbut rather try to clean themselves through several means before\nseeking His forgiveness and mercy?

Today,\nit is unfortunate that Christians are separated and scattered (in\ncharacter, beliefs, mission and purpose). There are so many rifts\namongst us and this does not reveallll us as good examples to the \nworld. Our unity and love should be signposts of being Christ\u2019s\ndisciples (John 15: 35). Today\u2019s lesson will open our eyes to the\nreasons for the separation in the Church today and how we can\nbridge these gaps.<\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s remarks here-->\n        \n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD <\/h4> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->       \n        \n        <ol type=\"A\">\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD -->\n        \n       <li><b>Reasons of Separation<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>There are many reasons why there is separation in the body of\nChrist. Some of them are issues of great variations, such as\ndenominational doctrines. However, Christianity is not only about\nhaving perfect church doctrines (the Pharisees were \u201coutstanding\u201d\nat this), but most importantly about having the right life, heart and\nattitudes before God. This is the focus of our study. What are the\nattitudes and behaviours causing separation in the body of Christ?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Selfishness:<\/b>One of the ways this is manifesting is in the strife\nfor positions of authority and leadership among Christ\u2019s\nfollowers. We saw this also in the lives of the twelve disciples\nof Jesus, how detrimental the quest for position could be and\nhow Christ rebuked and corrected their ideology (Luke 22:24;\nMark 10:37, 41-43). Today, it is still a great issue among Christ\u2019s\ndisciples. There is great danger in making earthly gain the\nforemost pursuit in our Christian service. Many go to church to\nsee how they can be served, welcomed, or valued rather than\nseek to serve others. Every attitude that seeks to please\nourselves at the expense of God, His will, the Church and others\nis selfishness in action.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Personality,Evil Association and Loss of Focus on Jesus:<\/b>Pastors, teachers, evangelists, church leaders and other\nministers carry out great tasks that should be celebrated and\nappreciated. Many times, we see them as our models, emulate\ntheir lifestyles and honour them as God\u2019s servants. However,\nwe must be careful that they do not become the ultimate focus\nof our faith and Christian living. We could see this in the lives\nof the Christians in the time of Paul and Apollos (1 Corinthians\n3:3-4). When we look up to Jesus as the author of our faith and\nultimate example, we will be made perfect in Him.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Tribalism, Caucus, Nepotism, and Prejudice:<\/b>At a time in the\nearly Church, there was dispute over service of food between\nthe Greek-speaking Jews and the native Hebrew believers. This\noccurrence would have greatly affected the unity of the growing\nchurch were it not quickly curtailed. (Acts 6:1). A similar thing\nis happening in the church today. There exist in the church\ndifferent groups and factions based on background, tribe or\nclass among members. Also, there is favouritism and prejudice\ntoward others. This causes separation, bitterness and disunity\namong members, thereby directing the focus of the Church\naway from pleasing God.\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Pursuit of Empty Traditions:<\/b>Some traditions are meaningful\nand very important in keeping the unity of the Church while\nthere are also vain,empty, non-beneficial traditions that have\ncaused disunity and unrest in some churches. For example, the\nJewish Christians and their rigid position on circumcision caused\ngreat discord in the church which eventually made their leaders\nto act wrongly (Peter & Barnabas in Galatians 2:11-15). As\nbelievers, we must evaluate our church\u2019s traditions and be sure\nthey are purposeful, edifying, and have not become stumbling\nblocks and walls of opposition to true Christian fellowship.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Many other reasons and attitudes abound for the separation\namong us as Christ\u2019s disciples; false teachings, territorial spirits,\nenvy and strife in ministry, competition, etc. Most of these reasons\ncan be traced to loss of focus and lack of genuine Christian love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b><\/h5>\n\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t<li>What are some other causes of separation among Christ\u2019s\ndisciples today?<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Is your Church, house fellowship, ministry unit united? If not,\nwhat are some possible reasons for the separation you have\nnoticed?<\/li>\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t<li><b>Effects of Separation among Christ\u2019s Disciples<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Bad Witness to the World:<\/b>Our ability to love one another\nand stay united despite our many personality differences,\nbackgrounds and ethnic groups should be a major part of our\nChristian witness (John 13:35). God expects that we showcase\nChrist\u2019s love by the power of the Holy Spirit and not live selfish\nlifestyles (2 Timothy 3:2). On the contrary, the church has\nbecome a reference point for discord, separation and malice.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Disobedience to God:<\/b>Our refusal to bridge the gap for a\nhealthy relationship amongst others shows that we do not value\nChrist\u2019s sacrifice on the cross. It also reveals our disobedience\nto God. It cost God His only Son, Jesus Christ to bridge the gap\nthat sin brought between us and God. Reconciling others to\nGod is not a choice but a command; it reveals God\u2019s love flowing\nthrough us. Doing otherwise is disobedience and rebellion to\nHim (1 John 4:10-11).<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Limited Impact:<\/b>When our relationships as Christ\u2019s disciples\nremain broken, we limit the expression of God\u2019s love within and\nthrough us. In loving each other, God\u2019s love is fully expressed (1\nJohn 4:12). A disunited body of disciples will not provide an avenue\nfor the Holy Spirit to express His power. Without the power of\nthe Holy Spirit, we would be limited in impacting the world.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Blinded Disciples:<\/b>A lot of Christians are confused, living in\ndarkness and frustrated because they have never enjoyed true \nChristian love and fellowship (1 John 2:9-11). They stumble and\nfall with ease because they lack purpose and focus. Such people\noften end up doing more harm than good to the body of Christ.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>How does true fellowship with other believers help\nand strengthen our faith in this Christian journey?<\/h5>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li><b>Bridging the Gap of Separation<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The task of bridging the gap of separation among us is not a call\nto live uniformly. It is obvious that no two people are the same and\nwe cannot all think or see things the same way. However, despite\nour differences, God\u2019s expectations from us are the same. His\ncommand to live at peace with all men and foster unity among\nbrethren does not depend on personality or background. Therefore,\nwe must exhibit certain characters that will foster unity and help\nbridge this gap.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Mind of Christ:<\/b>In our relationships with one another, we are\nto possess the mind of Christ (Philippians 2:3-5). We are to\npossess Christ-like virtues and mind-set which is characterised\nby humility, submission, obedience and sacrifice. Having the\nwillingness to live humbly and readiness to sacrifice our\ncomforts for the sake of others will go a long way in restoring\nour relationships with one another. After all, Jesus also did same\nfor our relationship with God to be restored.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Spirit-filled Lifestyle:<\/b>(Galatians 5:19-22, 26) It is impossible\nto restore relationships when we are under the control of the\nflesh. Someone living by the flesh displays anger, hatred,\ndiscord, selfish ambition, rivalry, etc., which further separates\nus. But when we allow the Holy Spirit to take charge of our\nlives, we would exhibit love, kindness, peace, patience, etc.,\nwhich will foster good and lasting relationship among us.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Giving and Fellowshipping with One Another:<\/b>When believers\nshare things in common such as food, possessions and have\nconstant fellowship with one another, the bond of peace and\nlove increases (Acts 2:46-47). As believers, taking time to\nfellowship together will enable us meet other people\u2019s needs.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Unity of Purpose:<\/b>Many believers today are overly consumed by\nvarious pursuits such as money, fame, popularity, etc., which further\nseparates us. On the contrary, the church at Jerusalem had things in\ncommon. They had the same mind, purpose and focus (Acts 4:32,\nPhilippians 2:2). This would not have been possible if their focus\nwas on personal gains rather than Jesus and the spread of the Gospel.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Ultimately, God wants us to also reconcile others to Him. If we\ntruly love God, whatever is dear to His heart should be dear to us.\nHence, we are to make every effort to bridge the gap between\nthem and God through Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>What are hindrances to fellowshipping together with\nother believers?<\/h5>\n\t\t\t\n\n <!-- BODY CONTENT HERE -->     \n      \n\n        <!-- END OF EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD -->\n\n        <h4> Facilitator\\'s Closing Remarks <\/h4>\n        <p>The separation of God and man occurred when Adam and Eve sinned by\ndisobeying God in the Garden of Eden.

They both demonstrated certain qualities that we\ncan imbibe, and which could help us minister effectively to believers\nof other generations. These qualities include:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Trust:<\/b>Paul trusted the ability of Timothy and he was willing to\nput him in charge of a church he had planted (v. 19). Timothy\nalso believed in Paul, and related with him as a father. From\ntime to time, he would seek his wise counsel in matters that\nconcerned his personal life and ministry. In like manner,\nbelievers should trust and be willing to hand over\nresponsibilities to people coming after them knowing fully well\nthat they are the leaders of tomorrow. Also, people of younger\ngeneration must learn to give respect to those older than them\nand seek wise and godly counsel.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Servanthood:<\/b>Timothy was humble and available to work for\nGod (v. 19). In a generation where everyone wants to be their\nown boss, it is increasingly hard to find young people who have\na servant\u2019s heart and are willing to do anything for the sake of\nChrist without hesitation. Most of them are always in pursuit\nof wealth, building their own empire or seeking after positions\nor fame. The work of the ministry demands being at someone\nelse\u2019s beck and call. When we go out to serve one another\nacross generational gaps, it becomes easier to serve together.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Not Superficial:<\/b>Paul saw that Timothy had good intention and\ncompassion for the Church and God\u2019s people (Philippians 2:20-21). He had a heart for God and the people and having worked\nwith him for some time, Paul was confident in his ability to\nlead God\u2019s people. It is possible that both of them did not go\nabout ministering exactly the same way but their heart for God\nand His people was definitely the same. Today, some of the\nthings that cause generational gap are things such as style of\nmusic, use of technology, packaging of programmes, etc.\nHowever, if our passion for God and His work are the same, it\nwill become a lot easier to serve together despite our different\napproaches.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Knowing one\u2019s Limitations:<\/b>Paul, due to his condition was limited\nin his ability to cater for the Church in Philippi. This made him to\nwisely delegate the assignment to Timothy. He recognised that\nthe work of caring for the Church was very important (v. 23-24).\nBelievers must recognise their limitations and weaknesses in the\nministry and be willing to seek help or in some cases hand over\nthe assignments so that the work does not suffer.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b><\/h5>\n\t\t\t<p>What are some limitations in ministry that are\nassociated with generational differences? How can we help each\nother overcome these limitations?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t<li><b>How to Minister to People of Other Generations<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Another major challenge that believers face is how to minister to\npeople of a different generation other than theirs. At certain periods\nof our service in the church, we will be confronted with one\nassignment or the other. There are certain truths we must imbibe\nto minister effectively:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Have the Knowledge of the Unchanging Word of God:<\/b>We\nmust constantly keep in mind that the most important tool for\nany form of ministry is the word of God. It contains wisdom to lead, words of encouragement and other things we would need\nin the ministry. The word of God is unchanging and has power\nto reach the soul of any man. Its power is not limited by age or\nlife experiences. When ministering to people of other\ngenerations, we can rely on God\u2019s word to help us.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Overcoming the Challenges of Life:<\/b>Many times, we are not\ncomfortable doing any ministry across generational gaps because\nwe are quick to see all the differences between us. However we\nmust remember that all of us irrespective of age are tempted by\nour desires (James 1:14) and no temptation overtakes any of us\nthat is not common to all mankind (1 Corinthians 10:13). When\nwe are willing to be open and transparent, we would realise that\nwe are mostly passing through the same temptations even when\nthey appear in different forms. This will also help those on the\nreceiving end of our ministry to relate to us easily. The world at\nevery stage, for every generation has always been filled with\nthe lust of the eyes, lust of the flesh and pride of life (1 John\n2:16). They have always been here, their manifestations may\ndiffer but its source is the same.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Same Destination at the End:<\/b>The Bible says that all men;\nsmall and great will stand before the throne of God (Revelation\n20:11-12). Whether young or old, when the end comes, we will\nall have to give account of our lives. Since know that all of us\nwill face the same end and judgement, it should fill us with\npassion and urgency to reach across generations, to do all we\ncan help one another to live lives that will please God\nirrespective of any differences. When we come before God,\nthe generation or time we lived in or were born in will matter\nvery little, what will matter most is the way we lived in that\ntime.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Share a time you had to minister to people of a different\ngeneration to yours.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Why are we quick to point accusing fingers at other generations\nas more problematic than ours?

A reliable\nstatistics on incest in 2013 says that approximately 1 in 4 girls and 1\nin 6 boys will be sexually abused by the time they turn 18 and that\n93% of kids are assaulted by someone they know and trust.

Unfortunately, the prevailing\npractices of sexual immorality have proved otherwise.

It also includes instructions about emotional relations\nand responsibilities, reproductive health, reproductive rights, safe sex,\nbirth control and sexual abstinence. It usually focuses on and begins\nwith adolescents as they enter the puberty stage but recent\nexperiences have shown that it is also necessary for children as they\nget to the age of accountability (ages 7 and above). Even the pre school\nchildren can be adequately taught at their level. Most adults also need\nsex education because they have wrong and inadequate orientation\non the subject. The African mentality of keeping silent about sexual\nissues because it is considered a sacred thing that should not be\nexplained to children requires a re-orientation.<\/p>\n\n\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>Mention some of the common lies or wrong orientation\nthat are associated with sex education from childhood to adulthood.<\/h5><!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->       \n        \n        <ol type=\"A\">\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD -->\n        \n       <li><b>Christian Approach to Sex Education<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The approach to sex education is very fundamental as it\ndetermines its content and outcomes. The biblical foundation of\nhuman sexuality is the right approach to sex education if it will be\neffective in curbing or alleviating the plague of immorality. This\nperverse generation needs a balanced approach to the subject\nwhich will focus on:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Sexuality and Purpose of Creation:<\/b>God created male and\nfemale for a purpose. When the purpose of a thing is not known,\nabuse is inevitable. He created bothmale and female as sexual\nbeings and primarily as spiritual beings that should long for\nand relate with God, the source of life. We are created to\ncomplement (help) one another without exploitation, to be\nfaithful and pure companions for each other without any ulterior\nmotive of sexual involvement and to consummate friendship\nbetween man and woman in marriage \u2013 as husband and wife.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Sexual Abstinence and Purity:<\/b>The biblical standard for young\nunmarried people is to flee all forms of immorality and abstain\nfrom sensual behaviours such as kissing, necking, pecking,\nintense hugging, etc., because they are means to the end of\nsexual intercourse. All appearances of evil must be avoided in\nmale-female relationship as well as exposure to pornography\nand immoralities on the mass media, social media and internet.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Self-Esteem:<\/b>There is a need to encourage a balanced and\nproper self-esteem, which acknowledges the differences in\neach gender and appreciates the uniqueness of individual\npersonality. This will help change the orientation of teens and\nyouth from copying some celebrities and practices in vogue\nsuch as losing their virginity, sense of reasoning and focus,\npromoting nudity and all forms of sexual perversions in our\nworld today.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Strategic Segregation of Facts from Salient Truth:<\/b>The facts\nabout sex education as taught in schools and the social\/mass\nmedia should be reviewed by parents and Gospel ministers\nwith the aim of identifying the extremes, indulgence or lies\ntherein and to treat them in the context of the Scripture. For\nexample, it is a lie of the devil that losing one\u2019s virginityreduces\nmenstrual pain. Menstrual pain can be managed naturally and\nmedically. More so, there is no safe sex outside marriage. The\nchurch should not shy away from speaking the truth about\nsexual urge (which is a gift of God) and sexual affairs but rather\ndiscuss it frankly and in the context of scriptural provisions.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>Continuous Study and Teaching about Sex and Sexuality:<\/b>Parents and Christian teachers both in \u2018mission schools\u2019 and churches should commit themselves to the study of sexuality\nand teach sex education from the biblical perspective. There is\nneed to review all existing contents of sex education (both in\nformal and informal settings) and develop a new curriculum\nthat will integrate the factors above for a more effective and\nimpactful sex education. Christian authors should be\nencouraged to write books and churches should also encourage\nmembers to buy bookson the subject matter for their personal\nlibrary, in their homes, churches, government and mission\nschools and other public organisations. The Church must not\nshy away from talking about sex education. It must be addressed\nfrankly and holistically in every platform where young people\nmeet (such as Royal Ambassadors, Girls and Lydia Auxiliaries,\nBSF and others).

Some school of thought believe that educators are in the best\nposition to teach sex education while another school of thought\nbelieve it is the responsibility of parents to teach children on this\nsubject.

Comprehensive sex\neducation is an essential part of HIV prevention. It is proved to be\nmore effective in preventing sexually transmitted infections than\neducation that focuses solely on teaching abstinence until marriage.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><b>Empowerment against Sexual Violence:<\/b>Sex education helps\nteenagers understand their biological make-up and prepares\nthem to live to glorify God in this perverse world so that they\nwill not fall victim of sexual predators. It also empowers girls\nand boys to speak up if their sexual boundaries are violated.\nSex education exposes young boys and girls to material that\nnot only reduces their risk of unplanned pregnancy and disease,\nbut also enlightens and empowers them.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>How do you make sex education beneficial,\neducative, and edifying to your children or you teach them with\niron hands?\n\t\t\t<\/h5>\n\n <!-- BODY CONTENT HERE -->     \n      \n\n        <!-- END OF EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD -->\n\n        <h4> Facilitator\\'s Closing Remarks <\/h4>\n        <p>When the purpose of a thing is not known, abuse is inevitable.

According to the\nNational Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control\n(NAFDAC), drug misuse refers to the use of drugs without following\ndoctor\u2019s prescription; this includes over dosage and under dosage.\nOn the other hand, drug abuse is the indiscriminate use of drugs\nfor non-medical purposes such that the emotional, mental and\npsychological state of the user is affected.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Drug misuse involves not following medical instructions which\nincludes taking a dose at the wrong time; forgetting to take a dose;\nstopping the intake of a prescribed drug halfway; and accepting\nprescription from a friend. A drug is also misused when the person\nhopes to get a faster therapeutic response from a medication such\nas sleeping or weight reduction drugs.Drug Abuse has to do with\nthe individual\u2019s intentions or motivations, for example, when a\nperson deliberately takes a drug to get a pleasant or euphoric\nfeeling, especially exceeding the prescribed dosage. People who\nabuse drugs typically do not get a prescription before taking the\ndrug. Drug Abuse is reflected not only in using a drug to \u201cget high\u201d\nor exceeding the recommended dose but in its chronic or repetitive\nuse thereby developing tolerance.Drugs that are misused or abused\ninclude pain relievers (e.g. paracetamol), tranquilizers, diazepam\n(valium), stimulants (e.g. amphetamine), and sedatives\n(barbiturates), marijuana and alcohol.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b><\/h5>\n\t\t\t<p>What is the difference between drug misuse and abuse?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t<li><b>Those Involved in Drug Misuse and Abuse<\/b>\n\t\t\t<p>Practically everyone is prone because no one is exempted from\nillness.

Thus, the benefits\noutweigh the risks when the drug is taken as directed. However,\nwhen a person misuses or abuses a prescription drug, there is no\nmedical oversight of the risks. Dangers of drug misuse or abuse\ninclude respiratory depression (pain killers), withdrawal seizures\nor convulsions (sedatives), hypertension (stimulants) and drug\ndependence. There could also be dizziness, tremors, mood changes,\nheart attack, stroke and loss of consciousness. Above all, we should\nnot be involved because as Christians, our body is the temple of\nthe Holy Spirit and we should honour God with them (1Corinthians6:19-20).

The skin is the\nlargest organ in the body with a total area of about 20 square feet.\nIt protects us from germs (microbes), helps regulate the body\ntemperature, and permits the sensations of touch, heat, and cold.\nIt has three layers: the epidermis, dermis, and the hypodermis.\nThe epidermis is the outermost layer which provides a waterproof\nbarrier and creates the skin tone. Next to it is the dermis containing\ntough connective tissue, hair follicles and sweat glands. The\ninnermost part of the skin is the hypodermis which is the deeper\nsubcutaneous tissue made of fat and connective tissue. The skin\u2019s\ncolour is created by special cells called melanocytes, which are\nlocated in the epidermis and produces the pigment called melanin.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Skin bleaching is the act of using chemicals in products (such\nas creams, soaps, whiteners, brighteners) to give the skin a lighter\nshade than it is originally or trying to make a \u201cdark\u201d skin \u201cwhite\u201d.\nSome beauticians say toning is for black people who just want to\ncorrect imperfections or uneven skin tone, or correct areas of hyperpigmentation\n(due to increased melanin production), at the knees,\nelbows, under the arms, and under the eyes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Due to age or other toxins in the atmosphere, the face and other\nparts of the body start to sag and show wrinkles. Toning of the skin\nis, therefore, said to be necessary for a youthful, rejuvenated feel.\nOther observers say that there is no difference or that toning is\nonly a milder form of bleaching as toning creams have a small\nportion of chemicals used in bleaching. Some people say toning is\na new terminology because the society frowns at skin bleaching.\nBoth skin bleaching and toning suppress melanin production,\nthereby preventing the skin from functioning well. Some people\neven go as far as doing skin whitening, a process where injections\nor capsules are taken to change the colour of the skin.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b><\/h5>\n\t\t\t<p>What is the difference between bleaching and toning?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t<li><b>Those Involved in Skin Bleaching and Toning<\/b>\n\t\t\t<p>Usually, those who have inferiority complex especially among teenagers\nand young adults bleach or tone their skin. Some middle and older\nadults are also involved. Research has shown that most teenagers\nprefer to use skin whitening products so that they can have a good\nstatus among members of their group, family, and society.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li><b>People Involved in Skin Bleaching and Toning<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>In some parts of the world, it is believed that light and pale skinned\npeople portray beauty, richness and success as well. Dark\ncomplexioned people are considered below standard. This is\ninferiority complex. The commercials shown on the television also\nportray this. Most people who use lighteners do so to remove skin\nblemishes such as freckles, spots, acne, scars, or discolouration.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>Do you agree that for a disciple of Christ, toning\nand bleaching of the skin is undesirable and injurious and why?<\/h5>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li><b>Why we Should not be Involved in Skin Bleaching and Toning?<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The Bible teaches that we are fearfully and wonderfully made\n\t\t\t\t(Psalm 139:14). This includes our skin. Melanin, which God has\nput in our skin, is a complex polymer derived from the amino acid,\ntyrosine, and it is responsible for determining skin and hair colour,\ndepending on the concentration present. So, the more melanin one\nhas, the darker the person is. It has an additional function of\nprotecting the skin from the damaging effects of ultraviolet rays of\nsunlight. If God has made us in His image, we do not need to make\nany improvements especially those that kill what is meant to protect\nand benefit the body.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Skin toning is counter-productive as the body produces more\nmelanin. Considering the vicious cycle produced, it is awaste of money\nbuying lotions and creams. In addition, the injurious effects of the\nchemicals (hydroquinone, mercury and corticosteroids) in bleaching\nor toning agents are many. They include damage to the skin, blood\ncells, bones, brain, eyes, kidneys (nephrotic syndrome), liver, and the\nrespiratory system. They can also produce severe birth defects in\nchildren born by mothers who use these chemicals. In the skin, they\nproduce thinning, uneven colour loss with blotchy appearance, redness\nand irritation, dark grey spots, acne and skin cancer. They could also\ncause cancers of the liver, kidney, and blood (leukemia).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>There could be increased appetite, weight gain, asthma,\npsychiatric disorders (anxiety, depression or psychosis), and\nperipheral neuropathy. There is also reduction in the skin\u2019s\nresistance to bacterial and fungal infections. It also causes delayed\nhealing or failure of healing of the skin when there are injuries and\nsurgical operations. Some of their effects could be seen almost\nimmediately while some are seen after prolonged use.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>Name six organs of the body that can be damaged\nby skin lotions and creams applied to the skin?<\/h5>\n\n\t\t\t<li><b>Steps to Avoid Skin Bleaching and Toning<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The first thing is acquisition of knowledge through instructions such\nas these (Hosea 4:6). Once the above mentioned effects of using\nover-the-counter skin whitening products are known, a wise person\nwill not only want to avoid using them and be natural, but also fear\nincurring the wrath of God (1 Corinthians 3:17). In addition, the\nHoly Spirit can set us free from such bondage as the Scripture says,\n\u201cso if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed\u201d (John 8:36).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>According to beauticians, there are natural ways of getting flawless,\nclean and fair skin without skin bleaching. These include good diet,\nwater, cleansing, as well as the use of limes and lemons. Experts say\nyour skin is what you eat. All refined food products must be replaced\nwith healthy and nutritious ones. Reduce sugar intake, vegetable oils,\nand food cooked on high heat which distort collagen. Increase water\nintake to prevent dehydration and to give a healthy look.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Cleaning of the skin must be properly done choosing natural\nand effective products. Citric acid can give a lighter skin tone without\nany side effect using a paste of lime juice, few drops of glycerin\nand flour. This can be applied on the face for 20 to 30 minutes\nbefore washing off with water. Dermatologists say the sun is the\nbiggest cause of skin damage and advise staying out of the sun\nduring the middle of the day when the rays are strong.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>In addition, wearing of protective clothing like hat, and using a\nbroad-spectrum sunscreen, one that protects against both types\nof harmful ultraviolet rays (UVA & UVB), are advised. Finally, using\na moisturizer that suits the person\u2019s body type is advised in order\nto keep the skin well moisturized. Moisturizing the skin everyday\ndoes not just help keep the skin smooth and hydrated but it also\nprevents acne and wrinkles. Ingredients to be on the lookout for\ninclude sheabutter, cocoa butter, natural oils, ceramides and\nhyaluronic acid. Omega-3 supplements are also helpful.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>Name six organs of the body that can be damaged\nby skin lotions and creams applied to the skin?<\/h5>\n <!-- BODY CONTENT HERE -->     \n      \n\n        <!-- END OF EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD -->\n\n        <h4> Facilitator\\'s Closing Remarks <\/h4>\n        <p>By now, this discussion should have opened our eyes to the dangers\nof skin bleaching and toning.

Smoking is the activity or habit of\nsmoking cigarettes. Alcoholism is the medical condition caused by\ndrinking too much alcohol regularly. Alcohol is a clear liquid that is\nfound in drinks such as beer, wine, etc. that can make people drunk.\nIt is also used in medicines, cleaning products, etc. According to a\nrecent survey by the WHO, Nigeria ranks 1st in alcohol consumption\nin Africa and 27th globally. Beer makes up 6% of alcohol consumption\nwhile other locally brewed drinks make up 94%.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><b>SMOKING:<\/b>Tobacco contains more than 4000 different chemicals\nthat react with the body in several ways. The most harmful of the\nchemicals are nicotine, carbon monoxide and tar. Nicotine is an\naddictive drug which affects the brain 7 to 8 seconds after it gets\ninto the body stream. It increases the blood pressure and changes\nblood composition and metabolism. Carbon monoxide replaces\nabout 15% of the oxygen carried to various parts of the body and\naffects growth, repair and prevents the absorption of important\nnutrients. It causes heart disease. Seventy percent (70%) of the tar\nin each cigarette smoked is deposited in the lungs causing lung\ndamage and inability of the lungs to protect itself from\ninfection.Smoking related diseases are myriad as smoking affects\nvirtually every organ of the body. Smokers have a greater risk of\nillness, premature aging, and premature death compared to nonsmokers.\nFemale smokers also endanger their unborn babies when\nthey are pregnant.\n\t\t\t\t<p>Passive smoking is breathing in another person\u2019s cigarette\nsmoke, and is just as dangerous as inhaling smoke directly from\nthe cigarette. Smoking related diseases include those of the heart\nand blood vessels (with sudden cardiac arrest and stroke), lungs\n(infections), eyes (poor vision), womb (infertility), stomach (ulcers),\nand cancers (lung, mouth, throat, nose, larynx, oesophagus,\npancreas, bladder, stomach, blood cells, lymph nodes, kidneys, etc.).\nPassive smoking may cause allergies and asthma. Smoking has\nbeen inextricably linked to poverty. Those addicted to smoking\ncan spend as much as 10% of their basic earnings on tobacco,\nthereby having less to spend on basic needs such as food, clothing,\neducation and health care.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><b>ALCOHOLISM:<\/b>Alcohol is a psychoactive substance with\ndependence-producing properties that has been widely used in\nmany cultures for centuries. Incessant use of alcohol causes a large\nnumber of diseases, social and economic burden in societies.\nAlcoholism ranks among the top five risk factors for diseases,\ndisability and death throughout the world (WHO, 2012). It is a\ncausal factor in more than 200 diseases and injurious conditions.\nDrinking of alcohol, like smoking, is, therefore, a very risky and\ndangerous habit as it adversely affects the brain, and depresses\nall functions of the body. The skin, kidneys, heart, blood vessels,\nlungs and muscles are immediately affected. The drunk loses almost\nevery sensation including vision and hearing as well as having\nbreathing difficulty. Intoxicated people fall and stumble because\nof loss of muscle coordination. Other results of intoxication are\nhangovers, sleep disturbance, irritability, anxiety, restlessness,\ntremors, physical weakness, fatigue, rapid heartbeat, mental\nsluggishness, difficulty in thinking clearly, poor memory, brain\ndamage, loss of consciousness, and death.\n\t\t\t\t<p>In addition, alcohol causes accidents, loss of inhibitions,\naggression, destruction, weight loss from poor nutrition, liver disease,\nhigh blood pressure, diabetes, kidney disease, impotence in men,\ninfertility in women, loss of libido, weak and thin bones, premature\naging and cancers (mouth, oesophagus, stomach, intestines,\ngenitourinary system, breast, etc.). There is also a weak immune\nsystem with difficulty in fighting off viruses, other germs, and all\ntypes of illnesses. Family members of alcoholics are often subjected\nto alcohol-related abuse, such as violent behaviours. Marriages in\nwhich one spouse drinks heavily often end up in divorce. Children of\nalcoholics often have problems relating with people. Growing up\nwith a parent addicted to alcohol often give children psychological\nand emotional trauma. A large percentage of people who abuse\nchildren are alcoholics. Alcohol does not only affect the one who\ndrinks, but also people around him.

He was raised in Eastern North Carolina in the tobacco\nbelt and the home of large tobacco companies. As a boy he worked\nin the summer to harvest tobacco and get it ready for market. His\nfamily always looked forward to tobacco season when they usually\nmade a lot of money. Personally, Cooper made money for himself\nthat enabled him to buy things for school in the coming year. At 15\nyears old, Cooper started smoking just like many other teenagers\ndid. At school, he would often use his lunch money to buy a pack of\ncigarettes which he smoked under a special \u2018smoking tree\u2019 in their\nschool playground. His sister died a horrible death at 47 years old\nafter she has been sick for three years. She died from lung cancer\nwhich the doctors said was caused by cigarettes. His father also\ndied from a condition that was partly caused by several years of\ncigarette smoking. His grandmother died of a terrible cough, after\nyears of smoking a pack of cigarette a day. Cooper had sinus and\nrespiratory problems and he tried to quit smoking but he said he\nwas so addicted that he could not quit, even when his health was\naffected. He smoked until he was 33 years old, two years after he\ngave his life to Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Because Cooper was addicted to smoking, he found it hard to\nquit even after giving his life to Jesus Christ. He was saved and was\nattending church, but he was still smoking. As a young Christian,\nhe knew smoking was not good but he did not want to be bothered\nabout it. He had tried to quit many times; he prayed about it\nearnestly but could get no victory over it. What was wrong? Why\ncouldn\u2019t he quit? He said, \u201cLooking back, I know the reason now.\nThe reason Icould not quit was: even though I knew it was wrong,\ndeep down I enjoyed smoking and did not really want to quit!\u201d I\nthink if most smokers who have tried to quit smoking will admit it,\nthey too really deep down do not want to quit because their\naddiction brings pleasure.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>One evening he came under a strong conviction that smoking\nwas a bad testimony in front of his own son and others he was\ntrying to lead to Christ. He realised he was a bad testimony for the\nLord and a bad example to his son, wife, church and the youth he\nworked with. He also realised that Christ suffered for his every sin\nand that every time he lit up and smoked, he was causing Christ\npain. He said if he had not quit smoking, his spiritual relationship\nwith the Lord would never have grown and it would have prevented\nthe Lord from using him. He would have remained a defeated\nChristian, unfit for the Lord\u2019s use. With the help of a friend (who\nused to be a heavy smoker too but has come to know the Lord),\nCooper finally quit smoking and had been useful for the Lord. He\nsaid, \u2018As I look back I know that if I had not continued to seek God\u2019s\nhelp I would have never overcome smoking and would not today\nbe a Gospel preacher and pastor.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>How can you help a person addicted to smoking or\nalcohol?<\/h5>\n <!-- BODY CONTENT HERE -->     \n      \n\n        <!-- END OF EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD -->\n\n        <h4> Facilitator\\'s Closing Remarks <\/h4>\n        <p>The Bible encourages us to flee from every appearance of evil\n(1Thessalonians 5:22).

A question might be asked as to whether or\nnot God prohibits any cutting of the body for medical reasons such\nas operations. The obvious answer is that God does not as He\nwanted the Jewish boys and men to have an operation called\ncircumcision. So God allows us to cut our bodies only for good\nreasons. We should remember that we are His temple (1 Corinthians\n3:16). However, incisions are made by both orthodox and\nunorthodox medical practitioners (which include scarification marks\nfor protective and curative purposes) as well as cultists. The latter\ngroups are the focus of this discussion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>What is your opinion now on tattoos and incisions? If you\nconsider their effects dangerous, why do people still engage in them?<\/h5>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li><b>Reasons for Indulging in Tattoo and Incision<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>According to the American Academy of Dermatology, there are five\ntypes of tattoos, which spell out why people are involved in\ntattooing. These are: traumatic tattoos, also called \u201cnatural tattoos\u201d\nthat result from injuries, especially asphalt from road injuries or\npencil lead; amateur tattoos; professional tattoos, both via\ntraditional methods and modern tattoo machines; cosmetic tattoos,\nalso known as \u201cpermanent makeup\u201d; and medical tattoos.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Many tattoos serve as rites of passage, marks of status and\nrank, symbols of religious and spiritual devotion, decorations of\nbravery, sexual lures and marks of fertility, pledges of love,\npunishment, amulets and talismans, protection, and marks of\noutcasts, slaves and convicts. The symbolism and impact of tattoos\nvaries in different places and cultures. Today, people choose to be\ntattooed for artistic, cosmetic, sentimental, memorial, religious,\nand magical reasons, and to show their belonging to or identification\nwith particular groups, including criminal gangs or a particular ethnic\ngroup or law-abiding subculture. An example of a medical tattoo\nis one used in skin tones to cover vitiligo, a skin pigmentation\ndisorder.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>What are the dangerous effects of both practices?<\/h5>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li><b>Reasons Why We Should Not Be Involved in Tattoo and Incisions<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Majority of Christians do not have issues with tattooing, while a\nminority of Christians uphold the Hebrew view against tattoos,\nunorthodox incisions and any form of body modifications, based\non Leviticus 19:28.Tattoos of Christian symbols are common. When\non pilgrimage, some Christians inscribe tattoo on their body, dating\nthe year and a small cross. This is usually done in the chest. Some\nof those supporting the practice use Revelation 14:1 and 17:5, in\nwhich names are written on foreheads, to support their action and\nto encourage the practice. However, it is uncertain if the term is\nmetaphorical as the language is prophetic. Christians with tattoos\nwill have a psalm or a verse of the Scripture tattooed on their bodies\nsuch as John 3:16; Philippians 4:13; and Psalm 23.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Health risks of body modifications will now be highlighted since\nthey involve breaching the skin. These include allergic reactions: tattoo\ndyes, especially red, green, yellow and blue dyes, can cause allergic\nskin reactions, such as itchy rash at tattoo site even years after getting\nthe tattoo. There could also be pain, swelling, tenderness, redness, or\ntissue injury at the site, which could be due to skin infection. Other\npossible infections are Tetanus, HIV, Hepatitis B and C, Tuberculosis\nand those due to drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. There could\nbe formation of thick, overdeveloped scars called keloids and\ndevelopment of nodules of inflamed tissue called granulomas.\nDifficulty could be encountered having a magnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI) scan performed as some tattoo inks and all piercing jewelry\ncontain metals. Tattoos are also not easy to remove later in life if one\ndesires to do so. Hence it should not be taken lightly.<\/p>\n\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\n\t\t\t<li><b>Steps to Avoid or Stop Involvement in Tattoo and Incisions<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>As previously emphasised, this is another instance in which God\u2019s\npeople can perish from ignorance. Tattoos and incisions are\npractices that Christians should not engage in (Ephesians 5:3).\nInstead of engaging in them, we should produce the fruit of the\nSpirit (Galatians 5:22-25). Those who seek to stop involvement in\nthem should receive counsel from experts for necessary remedial\nactions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>How can a person engaged in such practices receive help?<\/h5>\n <!-- BODY CONTENT HERE -->     \n      \n\n        <!-- END OF EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD -->\n\n        <h4> Facilitator\\'s Closing Remarks <\/h4>\n        <p>The Bible does not appear to prohibit tattoos for non-religious\nreasons. However, before people tattoo themselves, they should\nask, \u201ccan I do this in good conscience before God?\u201d The book of 1\nCorinthians 10:31 says, \u201cwhether, therefore, you eat, or drink, or\nwhatsoever you do, do all to the glory of God\u201d (NASB). If you have\nany doubts that God would approve such act, then to have a tattoo\nwould be a sin as whatever is against the faith is sin (Romans\n14:23, NASB). The Scriptures, however, admonish us not only to be\nhearers, but also doers of the Word of God (James 1:22).<\/p> <!-- Put closing remarks content here -->\n        \n        <h4>Activity Period <\/h4> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n       \t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li>Make a commitment today to consciously make your body the\ntemple of God always.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Parents and teachers should counsel teenagers, youth and\nstudents not to involve themselves in such acts.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n"},{"id":39,"title":"maintaining good health","message":"<center>\n\n            <h4>September: Week 5 <\/h4> <!--DATE e.g JANUARY: WEEK 1 -->\n            <h3>MAINTAINING GOOD HEALTH<\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\n\n<\/center>\n\n\n        <div >\n        <p> <b> HYMN: BH 87:<\/b>The Lily of the Valley<\/p> <!--HYMN - put the hymn number in the bold tag and the title after the bold tag-->\n        <p> <b> SCRIPTURE: <\/b>Exodus 15:26; Jeremiah 33:6; 3John 2.<\/p> <!--SCRIPTURE after the bold tag-->\n        <\/div>\n\n\n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4>\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, members should be able:<\/p>\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li>Explain their understanding of \u2018Health\u2019?<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Itemise at least five items in each health\n\t\t\tdivision on how to maintain a good health.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Pray for God\u2019s help to put into practice lessons\nlearnt this month through a new personal\nstrategy for their health.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n\n        <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n        <p><b> ICE BREAKING PERIOD:Discussion<\/b>  <\/p> <!-- please add the type of ice-breaking period task after the bold tag-->\n\n         <p>What are the components of health?<\/p>\n\t\t <!-- ICE BREAKING PERIOD CONTENT-->\n                    \n        <h4>Facilitator\\'s Opening Remarks<\/h4> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n        \n        <p>Maintaining a good general health includes addressing the\nphysical, mental, social and spiritual connections of who\nthe person is and how he or she lives.

Some\nof these reasons are:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t<li><b>For repentance and forgiveness of sins (Daniel 9:4-19; Acts\n26:18):<\/b>Sin no longer means anything to the people. Average\nNigerians believe you cannot live without committing sin. There\nare lots of bloodshed all in the name of power, fame and wealth.\nEven Christians who should be salt and light are not left out.We\nneed to pray against the works of the flesh and the devil in our\nlives and seek God\u2019s forgiveness for our numerous sins, so that\nour nation can become heaven on earth.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><b>For citizens and leaders to live a quiet and peaceable life of\ngodliness (1 Timothy 2:1-2):<\/b>When we look around us, ungodliness\nlike dishonesty, worldly pleasures, love of money, etc. are the order\nof the day. The fear of God is far away from the hearts of both the\nleaders and the followers. As Christ\u2019s disciples, we must stand in\nthe gap so that the citizens of this nation may live a quiet and\npeaceable life in godliness and reverence for God.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><b>For peace to reign in the affairs of this nation (Psalm 122:6;\n29:11):<\/b>Some people only pray when there is crisis. Many take the\npeace in their environments for granted and fail to pray for others.\nIn Nigeria today, there is unrest in some parts of the nation. Many\npeople are being killed day after day for no just cause. We need to\nrise up and pray for peace so that every part of the nation can\nexperience God\u2019s intervention. When we pray for the peace of our\nnation, we show how much love we have for her. Our prayers should\nbe a continuous one so that peace can be sustained.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><b>For God to heal our land(2 Chronicles 7:14-15):<\/b>Nigeria has\nbeen corrupted. When we compare the lifestyles of the people\ntoday with those of the past, we see a great difference. Today,\nyou will find that our children are exposed to things our fathers\nwere never exposed to when they were young. We cannot deny\nthat we are worse off today than decade ago.

We can therefore\nsay that integrity is a personal quality showing or indicating moral\nand ethical principles. Integrity is the basic element of Christian\ncharacter. It is one of the characteristics of a believer or someone\nwho has been welcomed into God\u2019s presence (Psalm 15:2). It\ndistinguishes godly character from an ungodly one. It could also\nbe said that integrity is a godly virtue that reveals the true state of\na person\u2019s life. It is a yardstick for godly leadership: \u201cSo he\nshepherded them according to the integrity of his heart, and guided\nthem with his skillful hands\u201d (Psalm 78:72).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Integrity is not determined by circumstances or credentials,\nand it is not to be confused with reputation. A person with the\nintegrity of heart is a morally and spiritually healthy individual.\nIntegrity has to do with a sense of consistency between a person\u2019s\ninner values and attitudes, words and actions. The more consistent\nwe are, the higher the degree of integrity we possess. No one can\nput a price tag on integrity because genuine integrity is not for\nsale. It cannot be bought with money. Integrity is revealed based\non the proof of being trustworthy.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\n\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>If a person comes to seek your help for employment\nknowing that you can without asking for something, and brings a\nhuge sum of money or material gifts along.Is it right to collect\nsuch gift?<\/h5>\n\n\n\t\t\t<li><b>People of Integrity in the Bible<\/b>\n\t\t\t<p>We have numerous of people in the Bible who upheld integrity\neven in difficult situations or moments. Examples include:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t<li><b>Joseph:<\/b>Joseph was a man of integrity. He stood his ground in\nthe face of temptation never to sin against God. When\nPortiphar\u2019s wife offered him her body, he refused to yield\n(Genesis 39:8). Even though opportunities were open to him\nwithout his boss getting to know about it, having committed\nhis entire house into Joseph\u2019s care, he said \u201cHow then can I do\nthis great wickedness and sin against God?\u201d (v. 9b). This shows\nthat he had God\u2019s fear in him. This nation also needs people\nlike Joseph who will stand their ground in times of trials and\ntemptations, having God\u2019s fear in their hearts at all times.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><b>Joshua:<\/b>Joshua is another man of integrity in the Bible. He\nrefused to compromise his faith in the only true God. When the\npeople of Israel was complaining due to the situation they were\npassing through, he told them to choose for themselves whom\nthey will serve but declared that he and his household will serve\nthe living God. (Joshua 24:15). As Christ\u2019s disciples, can people\ntruly say we are serving the only true God? Are you bold like\nJoshua to publicly declare that you are serving the living God?\nIf our nation will experience development, we believers must\nbe ready to show forth our integrity by showing to the world\nthat we serve a living God.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><b>Daniel:<\/b>Another good biblical example of integrity is Daniel\n(Daniel 5:13-17). Daniel\u2019s values, words and actions were\nconsistent. His actions matched his words. He showcased\nhimself as a child of God. Daniel did not defile himself with the\nking\u2019s food. More than that, he continued to pray to God despite\nthe trap that was set for him.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><b>For God to heal our land(2 Chronicles 7:14-15):<\/b>Nigeria has\nbeen corrupted. When we compare the lifestyles of the people\ntoday with those of the past, we see a great difference. Today,\nyou will find that our children are exposed to things our fathers\nwere never exposed to when they were young. We cannot deny\nthat we are worse off today than decade ago. We need to pray\nfor our nation so that God will heal our land.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Other examples are Peter, Paul, Dorcas, etc.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>Let class members mention some Christian leaders,\nwhether elected or appointed who at one time or the other\ncompromised their integrity in this country?<\/h5>\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li><b>Integrity: A Lifestyle that Matters<\/b>Christians should strive to live with integrity. This is what matters\nin the life\u2019s dealings. A person of integrity reflects Christ in words,\ndeed and actions. Such life is marked by love, compassion, mercy,\njustice, and honouring God\u2019s call above everything else. Apostle\nPeter gives the attributes of integrity in 1 Peter 3:10-11: \u201cWhoever\nwould love life and see good days must keep their tongue from evil\nand their lips from deceitful speech. They must turn from evil and\ndo good; they must seek peace and pursue it\u201d. Anyone who will\nwalk in integrity must steer clear of hypocrisy. We compromise our\nintegrity whenever we betray a trust. Integrity is a prerequisite to\ncredibility. It involves an inner sense of wholeness, which results\nfrom being consistently honest and morally upright. Integrity is\ncrucial in all aspects of life: financial, professional, personal, social\nand spiritual. The need for integrity today is perhaps as important\nas it has ever been. Integrity is essential if we will positively and\npowerfully impact others and change our nation for good.<\/li>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n <!-- BODY CONTENT HERE -->     \n      \n\n        <!-- END OF EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD -->\n\n        <h4> Facilitator\\'s Closing Remarks <\/h4>\n        <p>When a disciple of Christ remains\nin faith, he will do exploits for the Lord.

Simply, peace can be defined\nas \u201cfreedom from disturbance, tranquility, period in which there is\nno war or war has ended.\u201d During the First World War (1914-1918)\nand the Second World War (1939-1945), millions of lives and\nproperties were lost. The two world wars laid the foundation for\nthe birth of the United Nations Organizations (UNO). Even today,\nthere are records of killings everywhere. The purpose of God is for\nall to live together in harmony as one body, as we have it in Psalm\n133:1, \u201cHow good and pleasant it is when brothers live together in\nunity!\u201d And Hebrews 13:1 which says,\u201dkeep on loving each other\nas friends\u201d (NIV) is being defeated day after day. God is the Author\nof peace, not a God of confusion. That is the reason Jesus told His\ndisciples, \u201cpeace, I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not\ngive to you as the world gives\u201d. This shows that it is only in Jesus\nthat there is true and permanent peace.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>In the absence of peace, there would be no progress in the\nnation. Beginning from the family unit, any time we open pages of\nthe newspapers, particularly on weekends, we find stories of\ndomestic violence, spouses taking the lives of their partners, divorce\ncases, etc. When the family is not united, it will definitely pose\ndanger to the larger society. If there will be peace, such that will\nchange our nation for good, it must begin from us as individuals,\nfamilies and the church of God. As believers, we must be peace\nloving and peace makers. Remember that peace is part of the fruit\nof the Holy Spirit. We must promote peace wherever we go.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\n\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>As disciples of Christ, how can we promote peace\nin our nation?<\/h5>\n\n\n\t\t\t<li><b>Nigeria in Search of Peace<\/b>\n\t\t\t<p>It is no gain in saying that since independence in 1960, Nigeria\nis still in search of peace. However, when we flash back, beginning\nwith the issue of the \u201cWild, Wild, West\u201d orchestrated by political\nintolerance in the defunct western region. Many lives were lost\nduring the saga. Another instance is the massive rigging of elections\nbetween 1964 and 1965 that prepared the ground for military\ntakeover in January 15, 1966. Also, several coup and counter-coup\nplots took place that claimed many lives. The civil war between\n1967 and 1970, also called \u201cBiafra War\u201d claimed millions of lives\nwith lots of properties destroyed. Can we say that Nigeria has\nactually enjoyed peace at any point in time? Let us remember the\nreligious riots particularly in the North, the militants in the Niger-\nDelta region destroying oil pipelines, the agitation of the Movement\nfor the Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP), the Movement for the\nActualisation of Biafra (MASSOB) and Independent People of Biafra\n(IPOB). What of the current Boko Haram insurgency that started in\n2009, the spate of kidnapping, ritualism and Fulani herdsmen\nkillings? Definitely, we can say that Nigeria is still in search of\npeace.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p>Various measures have been taken and are still being taken to\nput peace in place in the nation but all to no avail. With the end of\nthe Civil War in 1970, General Yakubu Gowon (retired) initiated\nthe policy of 3Rs- Rehabilitation, Reconstruction and Reconciliation.\nThe late YarAdua regime also put in place the Amnesty Programme\nto soften the nerves of militancy in the Niger-Delta region while\nboth Dr Goodluck Jonathan and Muhammadu Buhari\nadministrations have tried, though not effectively, to put various\nmeasures in place for peace to reign in Nigeria.

Jesus said in John 16:33, \u201cI have told\nyou these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world\nyou will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.\u201d\n(NIV) Troubles will never cease in the world as long as we are in\nthe world. Satan and his cohorts are out there to bring trouble to\nthe world, most especially Christians. So long Nigeria is part of the\nworld, and we are in the world, unrest, killings, troubles, insecurity,\nand other vices will continue to exist. However as believers, we\nhave solace in Jesus Christ. He promises to give us peace\nirrespective of what is happening around us. The peace Jesus\npromises is not like the ones our past and present leaders have\nbeen promising yet unfulfilled.

We should demonstrate love for the nation\nby calling for justice, anchored in the very nature of God, through prayer\nand by proclaiming Christ everywhere we go. Lastly, our mission is to\nmodel transcendent living to the nation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n <!-- BODY CONTENT HERE -->     \n      \n\n        <!-- END OF EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD -->\n\n        <h4> Facilitator\\'s Closing Remarks <\/h4>\n        <p>The lessons for the month have challenged us as Christians to contribute\nto our nation\u2019s development through prayers, truthfulness, peace-making\nand right judgment.

Some of these verses go on to list reasons\nwhy we should thank Him, such as \u201cHis love endures forever\u201d\n(Psalm 136:3), \u201cHe is good\u201d (Psalm 118:29), and \u201cHis mercy is\neverlasting\u201d (Psalm 100:5). Thanksgiving and praise always go\ntogether. We cannot adequately praise and worship God without\nbeing thankful to Him. Like any wise father, God wants us to learn\nto be thankful for all the gifts He has given us (James 1:17). It is in\nour best interest to be reminded that everything we have is a gift\nfrom Him. Without gratitude, we become arrogant and self-centred.\nWe begin to believe that we have achieved everything by our own\nstrength. Thankfulness keeps our hearts in right relationship with\nthe Giver of all good gifts. Giving thanks also reminds us of how\nmuch we do have. The human nature is prone to covetousness. We\ntend to focus on what we donot have. When we focus on our\nblessings rather than wants, we are happier. When we start thanking\nGod for the things we usually take for granted, our perspective\nchanges. We realise that we could not even exist without the\nmerciful blessings of God.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t<li><b>Thanking God as our Creator<\/b>\n\t\t\t<p>Psalm 136 gives a vivid expression of God\u2019s love for humankind. It\ndescribes the wonderful deeds of God in creation. The psalmist\nacknowledged God\u2019s love by recounting the wonderful things God\ncreated and praised God for His sovereignty and love that\nendures.He praised Him for the heavens, the earth, the waters,\nthe great lights, the stars, the sun and the moon, and all His\nwonderful works (vv. 4-9). In addition, Psalm 100 gives us direction\non how we should thank God. The psalmist enjoins us to thank\nGod through shouts of praise, gladness in our hearts and singing.\nVerse 3 and 4 also sheds light on why humankind needs to be\nthankful to God. \u201cKnow that the Lord is God. It is He, who made us,\nand we are His; we are His people, the sheep of His pasture. Enter\nHis gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise; give thanks\nto Him and praise His name.\u201d(vv.3-4)This informs the reason why\nwe should always praise and thank Him for who He is on a daily\nbasis.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li><b>The Need to Be Thankful to God Our Creator?<\/b>\n\t\t\t<p>We should be thankful to God because He has not only created us\nbut also sustains us with His overflowing blessings daily. No matter\nwhat, we should be thankful for the following blessings:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t<li><b>Material Blessings:<\/b>We never seem to be satisfied with what we\nhave. But when we realise that every material blessing is given to\nus by God, we would be grateful to Him. King David prayed, \u201cWealth\nand honor come from you \u2026 We give you thanks, and praise your\nglorious name \u2026 Everything comes from you\u201d (1 Chronicles 29:12-\n14). As disciples, we must be thankful for everything that God has\ngiven us. A spirit of thankfulness makes all the difference.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><b>People around Us:<\/b>It is so easy to take people for granted, or even\nto complain and become angry because they do not meet our\nexpectations. But we need to thank God on behalf of those around\nus\u2014our spouses, children, relatives, friends and others who help\nus in some way. The Christians in Corinth were far from perfect,\nbut Paul in his letter showed gratitude to God for them, saying, \u201cI\nalways thank God for you\u201d (1 Corinthians 1:4). When a group of\nbelievers (whom Paul had never met) came out to greet him as he\napproached Rome, we read that \u201cat the sight of these men Paul\nthanked God and was encouraged\u201d (Acts 28:15). Thank God for\nthose who have impacted your life.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><b>Our Salvation in Jesus Christ:<\/b>God has given us the greatest gift\nof all\u2014His Son, who died on our behalf. \u201cThanks be to God for His\nindescribable gift!\u201d (2 Corinthians 9:15). We were separated from\nGod because we have sinned. But God loves us and wants us to be\npart of His family forever. That was why He sent His only Son into\nthe world to die as a perfect sacrifice for our sins. We must\ncontinually thank God who brought us salvation in Jesus Christ.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><b>His Presence and Power:<\/b>Coming to Christ is not the end but the\nbeginning of a new life. He is with us, and He wants to help us\nfollow Him and be obedient to His Word. As humans, we do not\nhave the strength of our own to live the way God wants us to live.\nBut when we turn to Him, we discover that \u201cit is God who works in\n[us] to will and to act according to His good purpose\u201d (Philippians\n2:13). Jesus promised His disciples, \u201cAll authority in heaven and\non earth has been given to me. Surely I am with you always, to the\nvery end of the age\u201d (Matthew 28:18, 20). In many countries a\nspecial day is set aside each year for thanksgiving. But for the\nChristian every day should be a day of thanksgiving, as we are\n\u201calways giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name\nof our Lord Jesus Christ\u201d (Ephesians 5:20).<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><b>In Times of Trials and Persecution:<\/b>We draw back from difficulties,\nyet not one of us is exempted from some kind of trouble. In many\nparts of the world it is dangerous to even be a Christian because\nof persecution. Yet in the midst of those trials we can still thank\nGod, because we know that He has promised to be with us and\nthat He will help us. We know that He can use times of suffering to\ndraw us closer to Himself: \u201cConsider it pure joy, my brothers,\nwhenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that\nthe testing of your faith develops perseverance\u201d (James 1:2-3).<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n <!-- BODY CONTENT HERE -->     \n      \n\n        <!-- END OF EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD -->\n\n        <h4> Facilitator\\'s Closing Remarks <\/h4>\n        <p>Disciples should be thankful to God who is worthy of our\nthanksgiving. It is right to acknowledge Him for \u201cevery good and\nperfect gift\u201d we receive(James 1:17). When we are thankful, our\nfocus moves away from our selfish desires and the pain of current\ncircumstances. Expressing thankfulness helps us to remember that\nGod is in control. Thankfulness, then, is not only appropriate; it is\nactually healthy and beneficial to us. It reminds us of the bigger\npicture, that we belong to God, and that we have been blessed\nwith every spiritual (Ephesians 1:3) and physical blessings. Truly,\nwe have an abundant life (John 10:10), and gratefulness is fitting.<\/p> <!-- Put closing remarks content here -->\n        \n        <h4>Activity Period <\/h4> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n       <p>Mention three reasons why we need to thank God as our Creator?<\/p>"},{"id":45,"title":"thanking god our great physician","message":"<center>\n\n            <h4>November: Week 2 <\/h4> <!--DATE e.g JANUARY: WEEK 1 -->\n            <h3>THANKING GOD OUR GREAT\nPHYSICIAN<\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\n\n<\/center>\n\n\n        <div >\n        <p> <b> HYMN: BH 18:<\/b>Praise, My Soul, the King of Heaven<\/p> <!--HYMN - put the hymn number in the bold tag and the title after the bold tag-->\n        <p> <b> SCRIPTURE: <\/b>Exodus 15: 26<\/p> <!--SCRIPTURE after the bold tag-->\n        <\/div>\n\n\n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4>\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, members should be able to: <\/p><!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li>Affirm that God is the Great Physician.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Recognise Jesus\u2019 role in healing them and express\ntheir trust in Him as the Great Physician.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n        <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n        <p><b> ICE BREAKING PERIOD:Discussion<\/b>  <\/p> <!-- please add the type of ice-breaking period task after the bold tag-->\n\n         <p>\u201cWe Care but God heals\u201d- discuss.<\/p>\n\t\t <!-- ICE BREAKING PERIOD CONTENT-->\n                    \n        <h4>Facilitator\\'s Opening Remarks<\/h4> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n        \n        <p>The Bible has record of accounts of healing from God the Great\nPhysician.

Then, He created\nhumankind and put them in a perfect garden with everything they\nneeded to be happy and healthy. Thereafter, God gave them one\ncommand: Don\u2019t eat from that tree in the middle of the garden.Adam\nand Eve decided to do exactly what God told them not to do: eat\nfrom that tree. From that time, humankind have been suffering\nfrom the effects of sin. One of those effects is bad health. But\nbecause God cares, He sent His only begotten Son for our salvation\nand healing. We can count on the Great Physician to heal us when\nwe are sick.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t<li><b>Thanking God for Jesus\u2019 Role as the Great Physician<\/b>\n\t\t\t<p>The coming of Jesus as Saviour is a great blessing to the world. His\nrole as \u201cphysician\u201d is so essential to His mission that He cannot\nbe understood apart from it. He wholeheartedly gave adequate\nattention to healing people during His earthly ministry. He healed\nthose who were sick:the blind, lame, deaf, leprous, paralyzed and\nmentally ill. When His opponents attacked Him for having unsavory\ncharacters such as tax collectors and \u201csinners\u201d among His disciples,\nJesus reminded them that \u201cIt is not the healthy who need a doctor,\nbut the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.\u201d\n(Mark 2:17). When Jesus gave His first sermon in Nazareth, he\nanticipated the possessive nature of the crowd when he challenged\nthem: \u201cSurely you will quote this proverb to me: \u2018Physician, heal\nyourself! Do here in your hometown what we have heard that you\ndid in Capernaum.\u2019\u201d(Luke 4:23). Jesus is the Great Physician who\ncame to heal the sickness of the world. In fact, even doctors do not\nreally know how healing takes place in our body because healing\nis the work of God and a miracle. We need to thank God for the\nmiracle of healing in our everyday life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li><b>\u201cWe (Medical Personnel) Care but God Heals\u201d<\/b>\n\t\t\t<p>Medical personnel are smart, hard-working, and compassionate.\nThey take care of people medically and we are grateful for their\nexpertise in diagnosing and prescribing medication. But this does\nnot mean that we have to put our faith in them rather than in God.\nFor reasons known only to God, He appointed humankind to be His\npartners in the work of caring for His creation (Genesis 2:15), and\ndoctors are among them. Doctors study medical science and know\nhow God designed the body. They use this knowledge to help restore\nus to a healthy condition. But the only reason doctors can do\nanything to make us better is that God created us with the ability\nto heal. Surgeons would be useless if incisions didnot heal.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p>Scientists can learn how God wired or fashioned our bodies to\nfunction, and they devise therapies to help restore or cure us, but\nthey are not healers; God is (Exodus 15:26). Doctors simply\ncooperate with God\u2019s original intent and design. We are grateful\nfor scientists and doctors, but our praises and thanksgiving go to\nGod, who designed an orderly universe and who created us with\nminds that can discover how things work medically. All healing is\ndivine because no healing takes place apart from God. We go to\ndoctors because we need help. In our suffering Jesus invites us to\ncome to Him. He is the Great Physician who holds our lives in His\nhand. He gives the healing, often through the ability He endowed\ndoctors. There is a greater rest Jesus offers.

The names of God\ninclude Jehovah-Ezer, which means\u2019The Lord my Helper\u2019 (Hebrews13:5-6, Psalm 33:20). \nIn the Bible, we see that each time God helped\npeople; they built an altar, a memorial or something to remind them\nof God\u2019s help. For example, Noah built an altar, Abraham built an\naltar called \u2018Jehovah Jireh\u2019, Samuel built an altar with gathered stones\nand called the altar \u2018Ebenezer\u2019, which means \u2018a stone of help\u2019 (1\nSamuel 7:12). Also, Jacob built an altar and called it \u2018Bethel\u2019. Joshua\ncollected 12 stones after God\u2019s deliverance, and Mariam danced to\nMoses\u2019 song after God delivered them from the Red Sea. Men can\nmiss timing, but God cannot.

This is more pronounced in this present\ntime when the society embraces social status and earthly significance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p>On the contrary, serving God owes believers kingdom\nsignificance and makes them richer towards God.

They look after\nsheep and provide grazing field and water for them. They do not\nbuild castles for themselves but stay and sleep where their sheep are.\nIn the story of the birth of Jesus, it is probable that this lowly lifestyle\nof shepherds made them to be the first to hear the good news about\nJesus birth. Our lesson today will highlight the attitudes of the\nshepherds in response to the good news of Jesus\u2019 birth.<\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s remarks here-->\n        \n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD <\/h4> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->       \n        \n        <ol type=\"A\">\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF EDUCATION\/INFORMATION PERIOD -->\n       <li><b>Seeking the Truth<\/b>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The people of the world seek after pearls and treasures. They are\nbusy looking for material things. But, in actual sense, what the world\nneeds is not material possessions or fame but someone, in the person\nof Jesus Christ. When the angel told the shepherds that Jesus was born,\nthey left what they were doing and went to see for themselves; not\nbecause they doubted the angel, but because they knew it was God\nsending the message to them. Also, they had an inner witness that the\nbaby was not an ordinary child. The attitude of the Berean Christians is\nlike that of the shepherds who would not be enslaved by \u2018easy believism.\u2019\nPaul, when commending the Berean Christians said, \u201cThese (Berean\nChristians) were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they\nreceived the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the Scriptures\ndaily, whether those things (which were told them) were so\u201d- Acts 17:11.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Believers should always seek and hear from God themselves\nrather than just act on what they are being told. This is because\nthere are false teachers and preachers everywhere whose intention\nis to deceive God\u2019s children. We should seek God to know the truth\nabout everything. As it is commonly said, \u201cif Satan cannot deceive\nus, he cannot destroy us.\u201d We should learn from the shepherds who\nreceived the message of the birth of Jesus and said to one another,\n\u201clet us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is\ncome to pass, which the Lord has made known to us\u201d (Luke 2:15b).<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\n\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>How do you feel when sharing information you\nwitnessed and are sure about as oppossed the one you heard about\nand are not very sure whether it is true?<\/h5>\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t<li><b>Accepting the Known Truth<\/b>\n\t\t\t<p>It is one thing to hear a message; it is another thing to accept the\nmessage as true.

So, they went to King Herod to ask where\nthe baby was born. Being a proud and jealous king, Herod asked the\nMagi to search for the baby then report to him where the baby lay so\nthat he could also go and worship Him. After the Magi had left, he\nbecame furious and planned to kill the baby. He felt insecure, having\nheard that Jesus is the new born King. He was jealous thinking that\nsomeone was about to take his place as king. From the 1stcentury to the\n21st Century, there exist people like Herod who fail to accept Jesus Christ\nas the Lord and King over their lives. They hold tightly to position, passion,\nfame and power rather than embrace Jesus as King over their lives.\nSomeone once said, \u201cThose who resist change will soon lose charge.\u201d\nHerod was one of those who resisted change and held on to status quo,\neven when God was working out the plan of salvation for the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\n\t\t<h5><b>Sharing Time:<\/b>What informed Herod\u2019s decision to kill baby Jesus?<\/h5>\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t<li><b>God knows All Motives<\/b>\n\t\t\t<p>Herod\u2019s response to the Magi that he would like to go and\nworship the new born King was a pretence.

In the world today, it is sometimes\ndifficult to know the intention of people. Little wonder the Bible\nmakes it clear that the heart of a man is desperately wicked.
